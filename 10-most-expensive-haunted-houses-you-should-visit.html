Thanks to the magic of reality television, viewers are able to follow the ghost hunters into some of the scariest houses around the world as they search for the paranormal. Some of these haunted houses are actual houses, while others are castles and mansions. If you’re curious, here is a list of the 10 most expensive haunted houses around the world and their claim to paranormal fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-franklin-castle-value-260-000><b>10. Franklin Castle – Value $260,000</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>This house was last up for sale in August of 2011 for a price of $260,000. Compared to some of the other haunted homes that have made the list, this is a fairly inexpensive price tag. Prior to a number of legal issues, neglect, fire and the fall of the Cleveland economy, this was once the home to a very wealthy grocer that turned to a banker. Built in 1865, the home experienced a number of unexplained deaths related to the home. The current owner has some plans to turn Franklin Castle into a quaint bed and breakfast; however, guests can feel confident that they will hear weird sounds when they opt to stay.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-kimball-castle-in-gilford-n-h-value-879-999><b>9.

The castle was built in 1897 by Benjamin Kimball after he was inspired by an interesting castle that he saw while in Germany. At the time, the construction of the structure cost $50,000, which would equate to over $1.2 million in modern dollars. The previous occupants of the structure have stated that the doors will open and close and they are able to hear the sounds of horses in the existing stable on the property.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-amityville-house-in-new-york-value-1-15-million><b>8. Amityville House in New York – Value $1.15 million</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>This house, located in New York has been the center of many movies and books regarding paranormal activity.

One year later, the Lutz family, which was not fazed by the killings, moved into the home and left only 28 days later due to the walls oozing, furniture moving, doors slamming and offensive smells.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-the-surgeon-s-house-in-arizona-value-1-2-million><b>7.

Lalaurie House in New Orleans – Value $2.3 million</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>This home, which was purchased in 1831, was owned by a couple that had many slaves, all of which they treated poorly.

Britannia Manor II – Value $4.1 million</b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>This home has gained the title of the most famous haunted house due to the filming of an HGTV special in 2007. The house was built back in 1987 and is located in Austin, Texas on the top of a hill. While the house may not actually be haunted by legitimate paranormal residents, it has been the host location for numerous spooky Halloween parties and haunted house fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-ennis-house-value-4-5-million><b>4.

Those that have no fear for the supernatural may love taking vacations to any number of the reportedly haunted houses or hotels to see if they experience anything, such as paranormal activity. For others, however this is definitely a no go vacation that will send them running in the other direction at the first scare or chill they feel down their spine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKano6l6psTPnqWsoaaaeqmt1Kernpxdnby2v8SsZLKnpWLAqbvUpZtmrpmotrV7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fans-are-hating-on-rachel-zeglers-snow-white.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans Are Hating On Rachel Zegler's Snow White, Here's Why">&larr;
