When she has something on her mind, trust us when we say that she’ll say it. She doesn’t hold anything back. And she’s definitely not scared to take on the big guys, no matter how much stronger or wealthier they are than her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=#>Leah Remini Reveals The Most Shocking Scientology Beliefs</a></strong></p><p>For the last several years Leah Remini has taken on the Church of Scientology and let’s just say that it hasn’t been pretty. Now that she has cut all ties with the church, she’s spilling all of their dirty little secrets. As you can imagine, the church is not taking this very well. And while Leah has been making a good side hustle while trying do single-handedly take down the church, this hasn’t been doing any favors for her career, sadly. As a matter of fact, the more she talks about Scientology, the less Hollywood producers want to work with her. Some would call it a coincidence, others would say there’s something more to it. Let’s not forget that some of the most influential people in the entertainment industry belong to the Church of Scientology. With that being said, we’ve got 15 reasons why Leah Remini might be making a huge mistake by bashing the Church of Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-made-tom-cruise-the-enemy><strong>She Made Tom Cruise The Enemy</strong></h2><p>Regardless of what your thoughts may be on <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> these days, there’s no denying that he still has a lot of power in Hollywood. He might not be the A-list celebrity or the heartthrob that he used to be, but he definitely has leverage in the entertainment world. Simply put, Leah Remini messed with the wrong person when she made Tom Cruise her number one public enemy.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Ways Scientology Likes To Control Tom Cruise And His Life</a></strong></p><p>Leah has said, “Scientology's a slow process in the beginning. It teaches basic principles of life&nbsp;– do unto others as you'd have done to you and be responsible. Then there are little courses that cost a little bit of money and you start to learn the concepts of Scientology, kind of like, "Scientology's a new religion and so it's being attacked, here's all the good works that we're doing." And you're like, "Why do people attack Scientology?" It slowly starts to get in your mind and your subconscious that it's Scientology against the world, and any enemy of Scientology is an enemy to mankind.” That right there speaks to what is happening to Leah now that she has publicly spoken out against the Church – they have made her into one of their biggest enemies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-called-the-cops-on-the-church-of-scientology><strong>She Called The Cops On The Church Of Scientology</strong></h2><p>Obviously, Leah Remini knows who she is messing with. I mean, she was a member of the Church of Scientology for years. If there is anyone who knows what is going on behind closed doors, it’s Leah. But to call the cops on the church to report a missing person, you don't do that. You don't ever go against the church. Leah should know that. She joined the church at the age of 9 when she and her mother moved from New York to Los Angeles. Her mother was introduced to Scientology by her boyfriend at the same and as a lot of people like to say, the rest was history. It took Leah 30 years to leave the church.</p><p>Leah said, “The decision to leave [the church] is you're giving up everything you've worked for your whole life. I feel that people need to understand this has been my whole life. As time goes on, you start to lose touch with the real world. The mindset becomes us against them.” Leah may have made the hurdle, but many members of&nbsp;Scientology&nbsp;are adamant in their support of the church.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-made-it-her-new-goal-to-bring-the-church-down><strong>She’s Made It Her New Goal To Bring The Church Down</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, a lot of people associate Leah Remini more with her disdain for Scientology than her actual work in Hollywood. Ever since she made it her personal mission to take down the church of Scientology, that’s the only kind of headline she’s managed to make in recent years. People associate her&nbsp;with exposing the injustices and the corruption of Scientology&nbsp;than her actual work as an actress and the mark she has made on the industry.</p><p>And when you look at it from a different perspective, that’s not good for Leah, especially in the long run. Sooner or later people are going to grow tired of her constantly complaining about the church. It’ll become old news. If Leah doesn’t stop, she’ll end up becoming old news, too. And that’s the last thing she would want to happen to her right now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-lost-all-of-her-connections><strong>She Lost All Of Her Connections</strong></h2><p>When you are a member of the Church of Scientology, there’s no denying that you’ll have some very strong connections to Hollywood. After all, Tom Cruise is not only the poster boy for Scientology but he’s also one of the most prominent figures in Hollywood, too. But when Leah Remini decided to make Scientology the enemy, it looks like they did the same thing to her, too. And as a result, she lost a lot of connections in the entertainment industry.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Things That Happened To Leah Remini After Exposing Scientology</a></strong></p><p>Leah once said, “You have big names in Scientology running around pretending to be the nicest people, and they take the care to talk to you and look at you in the eye, but that's all part of the process. That's all part of being in the church&nbsp;– to be a good example, to ingratiate yourself to Hollywood so that they'll say, "Hey, I don't know why you're attacking Scientology." It's all purposeful. I did it, I know!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-have-the-same-reputation><strong>She Doesn’t Have The Same Reputation</strong></h2><p>Leah Remini used to have a reputation as an actress who was dependable, always on time and reliable. After all, she is a tough cookie with a very good work ethic. These days, the only thing that comes to mind when you think of Leah Remini is her all out war with the Church of Scientology. And that’s not supposedly a good thing. She doesn’t want to be associated as a Scientology basher for the rest of her career, now does she? We didn’t think so, either.</p><p>Unfortunately, this might also be another reason why she’s not getting the same kind of work that she used to get on television. As many fans can remember, she was in the prime of her career during <a href=#>King of Queens</a>. She just hasn’t been able to pick up where she left off with that show in recent years.</p><h2 id=she-s-a-whistleblower><strong>She’s A Whistleblower</strong></h2><p>Here’s a cold, hard fact that is hard to swallow for some people: there aren’t a lot of whistleblowers in the entertainment industry. And that’s mostly because many celebrities know not to step on the wrong toes in Hollywood. Any wrong moves, and you can be blacklisted for the rest of your life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, that’s not to say that Leah Remini has been blacklisted by Hollywood, but it’s not like executive producers are tying up her line by calling her every day. In fact, it’s been quite the opposite. She’s struggled to make the transition from King of Queens to quite frankly anything else. Nothing is working out for her. Some critics are suggesting that Leah should think about toning down on her criticism and concentrate more on her career moves.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Chilling Claims From Other Scientology Defectors</a></strong></p><h2 id=her-life-is-too-much-of-an-open-book><strong>Her Life Is Too Much Of An Open Book</strong></h2><p>Leah Remini has basically reinvented herself as the Queen of Scientology bashing. Sure, she’s got a chip on her shoulder, but she’s also selling books, starring in reality television shows and going on endless talk shows to talk about her life after Scientology. As a matter of fact, a lot of people tend to forget that she’s even a television actress just because she’s made it her full-time job to heavily criticize the church.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has said, “I don't have to worry about setting a good example every day for the purpose of setting an example for Scientology. We should all set a good example in life, but this was with an agenda. Now it's about accepting what is. I have no agenda other than to enjoy my life and enjoy my time with people, for however long it goes... Because I was never really able to enjoy my life.”</p><h2 id=hollywood-is-afraid-of-her><strong>Hollywood Is Afraid Of Her</strong></h2><p>Leah Remini is a very outspoken person. We know that and we’ve seen her plenty of times in action. And because she’s very outspoken, a lot of people in Hollywood are afraid of her. That’s because they are afraid that once they get on her bad side, she might throw them under the bus the same way she did with the Church of Scientology. Now, this isn’t confirmed, but it might also be one of the reasons why no one is casting her in television shows or movies anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leah has explained, “I always had to go to Scientology or give my money to Scientology or give my time to Scientology, and now I'm just able to enjoy what is in my life. I don't have anywhere to get to. This is it.”</p><h2 id=she-messed-with-the-wrong-people><strong>She Messed With The Wrong People</strong></h2><p>Simply put, when Leah Remini decided to go after the Church of Scientology, she started messing with the wrong people. You don’t go after people who have more money, more influence, and more power than you unless you’ve got some strong back up behind you.</p><p>Leah once said, “There's a lot of things that are good in Scientology, because I wouldn't have been in it. And that's the thing: a lot of people trivialize this thing, like, 'Oh, it's Xenu, and it's a volcano, and it's jumping on couches and acting crazy.' These people are victims. We've been victimized. We believed in something because it starts out very normal.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Celebs Who Are Secretly Into Scientology & Some Who Obviously Are</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-have-back-up><strong>She Doesn’t Have Back Up</strong></h2><p>Speaking of back up, Leah Remini doesn’t really have any. While there have been a few actors and actresses that have applauded her for standing up for what she believes in, no one has really stuck by her side. And while she does have people like Jennifer Lopez to call as her best friends, no one has joined her on the Scientology bashing bandwagon. That’s because they know better than to start a war with a powerful group of people, and especially in the media.</p><p>Leah even confessed a few years back, “I envision Hollywood as a race, and some people simply drop off before their turn comes around. It's all about stamina&nbsp;– your ability to get back up and keep going even though everything is pointing at the odds not being in your favor.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=life-after-king-of-queens><strong>Life After King Of Queens</strong></h2><p>We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Leah Remini’s prime was during her nine years on the King of Queens. Not only was it a great television comedy, but it was also a great show for Leah. She got the show off her acting chops and her perfect comedic timing. After all, Leah herself said that if it weren’t for some of the skills she learned during her years as a Scientologist, she wouldn’t be where she is today. The church might have done some awful things for her, but it also taught her the discipline she needed to make it in Hollywood.</p><p>Unfortunately, life after the King of Queens just hasn’t been the same. While other actors and actresses have transitioned to movie or other television work, Leah is still in the same place. She has yet to find her new niche now that she has left the church, and that is a little bit worrisome.</p><h2 id=she-wasn-t-a-hollywood-star-to-begin-with><strong>She Wasn’t A Hollywood Star To Begin With</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it: even Leah Remini’s biggest fans out there know that she was never a Hollywood star to begin with. A lot of people either know her as “that actress from the King of Queens” or Jennifer Lopez’s best friend from television. And now people tend to label her as “that actress who can’t stop talking about Scientology.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, when it comes to other Scientologist members, they’ve managed to carve their way through the cut throat entertainment industry. I mean, just look at Tom Cruise. He’s a huge household name all over the world. The same can be said about John Travolta, Jerry Seinfeld, Juliette Lewis, Elisabeth Moss, and so many more. Erika Christensen even once said, “Scientology helps me in acting to focus on communication. It's a study [that helps] see people as spiritual beings. And in Hollywood, that's more stable than being a hunk of meat."</p><h2 id=even-her-reality-show-can-t-bring-in-ratings><strong>Even Her Reality Show Can’t Bring In Ratings</strong></h2><p>Sure, Leah Remini has been given her own television platform to talk about her fall out from the church. But is anyone really watching it? Yeah, we didn’t think so, either. There’s only so much that you can repeat over and over again, Leah. And sadly, it seems like her fans are tuning out more than they are tuning in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though her A&E reality television show has just been renewed for a third season, it’s not getting the promotional campaign that it needs to survive long term. Not many people are booking Leah Remini on talk shows like they used to. At this point it’s safe to say that her post-Scientology career is dwindling rather fast. She needs to come up with a Plan B before it’s too late.</p><h2 id=hollywood-thinks-she-s-too-aggressive><strong>Hollywood Thinks She’s Too Aggressive</strong></h2><p>Leah Remini was born and raised as a tough girl from the Bronx. She makes no apologies about anything in her life. And while a lot of people appreciate her openness and her candor, a lot of people think that she might be a little too aggressive in her ideas and opinions. At least, according to those in Hollywood and their taste. Leah isn’t like the other actresses in the industry. She’s not one to remain quiet and she won’t put up with anyone’s lies, if you know what we mean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while a lot of people think that this is one of Leah’s greatest assets, other people believe that this has contributed to her downfall, too. When it comes to Hollywood and Scientology, you can’t get away with saying whatever is on your mind. The industry doesn’t operate that way.</p><h2 id=can-she-be-trusted><strong>Can She Be Trusted?</strong></h2><p>Now, no one knows what is next for Leah Remini, both personally and professionally. But what we do know is that she is still struggling to find her place in this world even though she left the church several years ago. Some reports have even indicated that Leah is in therapy as she’s having a hard time adjusting to her new reality.</p><p>Also, her television show, Scientology and the Aftermath, has just been picked up for a third season on the A&E network. But apparently Leah is so paranoid about the church that she’s having a hard time opening up about even more details and allegations about their cover-ups. She feels as though someone is always watching her and not in a good way, of course. Watch this space. We have a feeling that this is only the beginning of Leah’s all-out war with Scientology. How it will end, though, is anyone’s guess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Celebs Tom Cruise Convinced To Become Scientologists Vs.
