When the girls started to drive, Yearwood and her husband, Garth Brooks, quickly realized how difficult it was to have them all in the same room, which is when they introduced "veggie night."</p><p class=Fg>"Veggie night" was simultaneously the one night a week when the whole family was together and a way to get their children to eat more vegetables, according to Yearwood.
