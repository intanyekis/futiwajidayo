The man has been thriving for decades, and this is largely thanks to his film career. <a href=#>Wahlberg hasn't always gotten the roles that he's wanted</a>, and <a href=#>he's even disliked some of his own films</a>, but through it all, the man has been a major success in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the 2000s, Wahlberg and <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> starred in a box office bomb that featured Wahlberg playing a rock singer. Even now, people are still wondering if he actually sang in the movie.</p><p>Let's take a closer look and see if he sang in the flick.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-mark-wahlberg-and-39-rock-star-39>What Happened With Mark Wahlberg And 'Rock Star'?</h2><p>As a genuine example of a crossover star, Mark Wahlberg is someone who has had a tremendous career in entertainment.</p><p>After becoming a rapper and finding success on the Billboard charts, Marky Mark set his sights on acting. Fans were skeptical, but he turned heads with some solid performances. The Basketball Diaries and Fear were great, and Boogie Nights really put him on the map.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once the Marky Mark label was shed, Wahlberg blossomed into an A-list star. Projects like The Perfect Storm, The Italian Job, The Departed, The Fighter, and Ted all allowed Wahlberg to show the world what he was capable of. After turning in a sublime performance in The Departed, the actor found himself nominated for an Academy Award.</p><p>At this stage, the man has a countless number of hits under his belt. As great as that is, the truth is that he has had some misfires during his time on the big screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Noticed Mark Wahlberg Was Completely Intoxicated During This Awkward Live TV Interview</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-wahlberg-39-s-39-rock-star-39-failed-at-the-box-office>Mark Wahlberg's 'Rock Star' Failed At The Box Office</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2001, Wahlberg starred in Rock Star, a film that not many people seem to remember. While it may be a forgotten flick from the 2000s, the movie is certainly worth looking back on.</p><p>The movie, which was about an unknown singer taking over singing duties in his favorite band, was loosely based on Judas Priest. Wahlberg starred in the film alongside Jennifer Aniston and Timothy Olyphant, who all turned in good performances. Wisely, the producers opted to bring in actual rock musicians to work alongside the cast on screen in the movie.</p><p>Alter Bridge singer, Myles Kennedy, played a major part in the movie's ending, and he talked about his experience in an interview.</p><p>"They wanted someone who could sing and also play the role. So he threw my name out there, and they reached out to me. So I’m very grateful to Brendan for that. But yeah, I had never acted before, and I haven’t acted since [laughs]. But it was a really cool experience for me, nonetheless. I got to step into this entirely different world, and see how different the film industry is compared to the music industry," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Kennedy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, Rock Star did have a lot to like, but it was a commercial flop at the box office. Fans of the movie still enjoyed it, but they've long had one question: did Mark Wahlberg actually sing in the movie?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sad Truth About Mark Wahlberg's Relationship With His Daughter, Ella Rae</a></span></p><h2 id=did-wahlberg-actually-sing-in-39-rock-star-39>Did Wahlberg Actually Sing In 'Rock Star'?</h2><p>So, did Mark Wahlberg actually do the singing in Rock Star? While he certainly lent a hand and did some singing, he wasn't the only person behind the mic.</p><p>"I’d have to listen closely. I studied with the vocal coach for six months, but we also had somebody else who sang the songs. But we also had somebody else who sang the songs. But whenever we performed, we performed live, so–I’d have to pay attention to. If I could hit them all, it would only be my voice," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Wahlberg</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as who helped Wahlberg's character truly shine as a vocalist, the film utilized the talents of actual rock singers.</p><p>According to IMDb, "The singing is done by Miljenko Matijevic, who sang for Steelheart, and Jeff Scott Soto, who sang for Yngwie Malmsteen and Journey, among others."</p><p>It's pretty remarkable to see the type of work that went into making the movie, especially in regard to the singing. Then again, when the entire plot of a movie is focused on a singer rising from rags to riches, it makes sense that everything had to be as dialed in as possible for the project.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does John Cena Really Feel About Mark Wahlberg?</a></span></p><p>Mark Wahlberg might not have done all the singing in the movie, but it's cool to learn that he did lend a hand to what audiences heard in the movie and on the soundtrack.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Ryan Gosling Lost Out On A Role To Mark Wahlberg For Being Out Of Shape</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoq6zt4ywmKGkkpq%2FqHnSoqWgZZmjerO7wqRkrKyRp3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./garret-dillahunt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Garret Dillahunt: Marriage, Career, and Net Worth">&larr;
