She is known to many as the wife of Daniel Craig, an actor, and producer who is famous for his role as James Bond in the Bond film series; Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015), and No Time To Die (2021).</span></p><p>With questions buzzing about Fiona’s whereabouts and career, it’s worth noting that multiple factors have preceded her now private life. Her failed marriage and brief career top the list of many others which have not been disclosed to the media. Here’s all we know about her family, marriage, and whereabouts.</p><p><b><p>Personal Profile</p></b></p><h2><strong>Fiona Loudon’s Life Before Fame and Career</strong></h2><p><span>Fiona Loudon was born on May 5, 1968, and was raised in Scotland, United Kingdom. According to reports, her father was a theatre actor while her mother was a pianist. The now 55 -year-old has been very private about her life as well as her family which leaves us with no further information about her parents. Similarly, other members of her family are not known hence she could be the only child born to her parents.</span></p><p><span>Growing up in an artistic family soon spurred Fiona’s interest in entertainment. She was very active in her high school drama club and appeared in a number of plays. Consequently, she decided to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.</span></p><p><span>Fiona subsequently moved to London where she enrolled at the University of London in 1986. There, she studied art and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1990. Furthermore, she started her career in the entertainment industry mainly in theatre and movies but her works were not captured.</span></p><h2><strong>Her Marriage and Divorce From Daniel Craig</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/loveohlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fiona-Loudon-and-her-family.jpg><p>As stated, Fiona came into the limelight following her marriage to fellow actor Daniel Craig. The pair first met at the beginning of their acting careers in London and soon became friends. Some quarters report that they met in the late 80s during an organized party by a mutual friend. While the exact time of their meeting has not been recorded, we gathered that they were both in their 20s at that time.</p><p>Daniel and Fiona soon became very fond of each other and decided to make a long-lasting commitment which saw them exchange marital vows in 1992 and later welcomed a daughter named Ella Craig.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pair divorced in 1994. Information regarding what would have led to their unfortunate separation is still elusive to the media. However, Daniel hinted in an exclusive interview that they were both young and distracted by a lot of factors.</p><p>It’s evident that the pair met at the start of their careers and probably couldn’t balance building a family and pursuing a career at the same time. It’s just sad that their marriage had to suffer for it.</p><h2><strong>Has Fiona Loudon Remarried?</strong></h2><p>The former actress has chosen to stay unmarried since her divorce from Daniel even though chances are high that she may have tried other relationships. However, she has not committed to any yet.</p><p>Contrary to this, her husband found love again. He had a brief relationship with a German actress known as Heike Makatsch and film producer Satsuki Mitchell. His relationship with the former lasted for about seven days before they parted ways in 2004.</p><p>In the same vein, he dated the latter for a few years and even got her engaged but the relationship between them went south in 2010 following irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Subsequently, Fiona Loudon’s ex-husband finally remarried after 15 years of parting ways with her. His relationship with Rachel Weisz made the news in December 2010 and the following year they got married.</p><p>Like his first marriage, this was also a private ceremony that reportedly had only four people in attendance including his daughter Ella.</p><p>Rachel is an English actress who was born on March 7, 1971, and is currently 52 years old. The pair welcomed their first child in 2018 and are very <a href=# rel=noopener>private about their relationship</a>.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Adria Hight: Her Marriage To Robert Hight, Other Facts</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Where is Daniel Craig’s Ex-Wife Now?</strong></h2><p>After Fiona’s separation from her ex-husband Daniel Craig in 1994, she simply embraced a life of privacy, and very little is known about her. It’s said that she forfeited her career in the entertainment industry to take care of her daughter Ella.</p><p>Though Fiona may not have plans of returning to the entertainment industry, Her daughter, Ella has decided to take up an acting career. Ella first started her theatre career with the Shakespeare and Company stage plays.</p><p>Moving on, she starred in movies like Memory Paradigm (2007), Nara (2008), Texas Road (2010) and <a href=# rel=noopener>Trauma is a Time Machine</a> (2018).</p><p>Ella has also put her height and body physique to good use as a model. She has worked with the Fords Models and fronted Scottish lifestyle magazines like Hood Magazine among many others.</p><p>As it is, Fiona is reportedly living in London with her daughter Ella.</p><p>However, information about her current career pursuits is not known to the media. What is known is that the mother of one is still alive and hopefully hearty.</p><p>Following Fiona’s decision to live away from the spotlight, this could mean that are acting years are over and chances of a possible comeback are slim. While this may be disturbing to her fans, her daughter Ella has fitted just well into her acting shoes and we expect stellar performances in the coming years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikn6uysLTLrqqtZpOkunCyyKilmmWcpMKlu81mm5qmmZq5bq%2FRmqCgZZWteri1xZ5km6GfYsSpsdGeZK2nlJbGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./raw-elias-samson-guitar-cut-finn-balor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Finn Balor Busted Open By Elias Samson On Raw">&larr;
