However, since famed Parisian designer Coco Chanel made tanning all the rage in the 1930's, both women and men have been carrying these fashionable and practical accessories to protect themselves from the rain. April showers are just around the corner so it's time to spring forward and be elegantly prepared for the downpour!</p><p>The rich and stylish are not only protecting their designer clothes and freshly coiffed hair from raindrops, they're also considering these contraptions as a staple accessory to their wardrobes. Although some people are once again wisely using umbrellas as parasols for sun shade, in rainy coastal areas they are an absolute necessity for everyone's closet. The selection today is magnificent, ranging from luxurious classic designs to handy travel sized models.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>England, and particularly London is known for it's rainy weather and is often regarded as a city of umbrellas. Jonas Hanway (1712-1786) was an English tradesman who was famous for making umbrellas an essential part of every gentleman's attire. Yet Berlin, Germany is known as the birthplace of the first telescoping pocket umbrella in the 1920's. This is considered a huge step in making the umbrella as convenient as it was stylish. The handles alone are as crucial to the construction of these designs as the canopy, often artistically designed in gold-plate, sterling silver, leather, bone or precious woods. They sometimes have integrated flashlights, compasses or even 'seats' for sporting events!</p><p>Vintage Chanel umbrellas can sell for as much as $1,500, and for some members of the "Billionaires Club" founded by Formula One mogul <a title="Flavio Briatore Net Worth" href=#>Flavio Briatore</a>, a custom made umbrella will cost a hefty $50,000. His "Billionaire Couture" London boutique will craft this incredibly decadent and eccentric umbrella entirely from crocodile skin. Although many criticize Briatore for his ostentatious line, he defends the rich's right to luxury attracting such style icons as <a title="David Beckham Net Worth" href=#>David Beckham</a> and <a title="Sean Combs â€“ Diddy Net Worth" href=#>Sean "Diddy" Combs</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone willing to spend indulgently can treat themselves to these extravagant umbrellas.
