From The Simpsons, BoJack Horseman and Family Guy, to the likes of Bob’s Burgers, Futurama and Archer, it takes a very special production to even be considered in the conversation of being among the best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One show which definitely managed to break this barrier was King of the Hill, which aired on Fox between 1997 and 2009. The sitcom is currently available to stream on Hulu, having also enjoyed a spell on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> before it was removed in 2013.</p><p>King of the Hill is the brainchild of Ecuadorian-born American actor, animator and writer Mike Judge. He created the concept for the show alongside seasoned TV writer Greg Daniels, known for his work in, among others: <a href=#><strong>SNL</strong></a>, Parks and Recreation and <a href=#><strong>The Office</strong></a>.</p><p>The Fox animation became so popular over its tenure on air, top Hollywood stars like Reese Witherspoon, Brad Pitt and Snoop Dogg <a href=#>lent their voice to various characters</a> on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is The Most Famous Episode Of 'King Of The Hill'?</a></span></p><p>Judge has continued to work on other projects since King of the Hill, but he would have really built up his wealth over the years when the show was being broadcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-premise-of-king-of-the-hill>What Is The Premise Of King Of The Hill?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to IMDb</a>, King of the Hill tells the story of “Hank Hill, a propane gas salesman in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, [who] is often besieged by the idiosyncrasies of society, but finds some serenity in his home life with his wife, substitute Spanish teacher Peggy, his awkward son Bobby, and his live-in niece-in-law Luanne Platter.”</p><p>“Adding flavor [are] Hank's friends, divorcé military barber Bill Dauterive, paranoid Dale Gribble (with an obsession with government conspiracy theories), and gibberish-spouting Boomhauer,” the plot summary concludes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>IMDb ranks King of the Hill as the sixth-best sitcom of all time, just above Family Guy and behind the likes of Rick and Morty, South Park,The Simpsons and Futurama.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Origin Of Futurama's Hypnotoad And How It Became The Most Meme-Able Character On The Show</a></span></p><p>As well as being the creator, Mike Judge voiced the main roles of Hank Hill and Boomhauer, as well as a varied number of other characters. Kathy Najimy (Peggy), Pamela Adlon (Bobby), Stephen Root (Bill) and Johnny Hardwick (Dale) were all part of the main cast as well.</p><h2 id=how-rich-is-mike-judge-in-2022>How Rich Is Mike Judge In 2022?</h2><p>Mike Judge would have made money on an episodic basis as creator, writer and actor in King of the Hill. At the same time, it is likely that he continues to earn more through royalties and residuals thanks to the syndication of the show since the final episode aired on Fox in September 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as all the other work he has done in his three-decade long career, all this income has helped Mike Judge to amass an impressive net worth of around $75 million. This is according to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimate by Celebrity Net Worth</a>. It also compares favorably to that of his colleague Greg Daniels, who is said to be worth around $50 million.</p><p>When compared to other creators of animated sitcoms, however, Judge’s wealth is rather meek. <a href=#>Seth MacFarlane is known for conceptualizing</a>, writing and voicing various characters in Family Guy. He is reportedly worth around $300 million currently.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Johnny Bravo' And The Classic Cartoons Seth MacFarlane Worked On Before 'Family Guy'</a></span></p><p>Maker of South Park and Futurama Matt Groening’s total wealth is valued at around $600 million. Trey Parker and Matt Stone – who created Southpark – have a combined net worth of about $1.3 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-work-has-mike-judge-done-before-and-after-king-of-the-hill>What Work Has Mike Judge Done Before And After King Of The Hill?</h2><p>Mike Judge’s work in King of the Hill has managed to transcend the barriers of time, as it continues to be an audience favorite to date. Even on social media, the show is <a href=#>the source of various memes</a>, which suggests that it was rather underappreciated during the period when it was broadcasting on Fox.</p><p>Before he created this classic, though, Judge had already been working in the industry for about six years. Until that point, he was known for having also created Beavis and Butt-Head, another adult animated series for MTV. The multi-talented star also voiced the two lead characters on that show as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After its original run between 1993 and 1997, Beavis and Butt-Head was revived for a single season in 2011, and then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">again on Paramount+ in August</a> this year.</p><p>Since the end of King of the Hill on Fox, Judge has also worked on The Goode Family, Silicon Valley and Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus. He also wrote and directed the movies Idiocracy and Extract.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqabYr2trdiem2aaqWK6qrfEZqGunJeaeqy1zaBkqJ5dqbWmeceio6VlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dwayne-the-rock-johnson-surprises-mom-cousin-houses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Rock Surprises His Mom &amp;amp; Cousin With Houses In The Same Month">&larr;
