The show ran from 2006 to 2010 and the catchy theme song, "Unwritten," by Natasha Bedingfield still plays in everyone’s mind when they think about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Conrad</a> going to&nbsp;FIDM to earn her degree in fashion and work for Teen Vogue as an intern. On the show, Lauren Conrad was such a sweet young woman with a big heart. She was extremely wise and mature for her age, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of “The Hills”: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><p class=p1>Before Lauren Conrad decided to leave the show, she dealt with a lot of highs and lows. A lot of those highs and lows revolved around her friendships, which were always a big deal to her. Here are six of her best friends and four of her biggest enemies from her time on The Hills.</p><h2 id=bff-lo-bosworth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>BFF: Lo Bosworth</span></h2><p class=p1>Lo Bosworth was easily one of Lauren Conrad's closest friends on the show. They knew each other since they were kids, and so they had a deeper emotional connection and bond. The fact that they had known each other for so many years is what made them so much closer in their adulthood.</p><p class=p1>They had a lot of things in common and could relate when it came to fashion, dating, going out, and everything else. They always had each other‘s back and their friendship never wavered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enemy-spencer-pratt><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Enemy: Spencer Pratt</span></h2><p>Lauren Conrad’s biggest enemy from her time in The Hills would definitely have to be Spencer Pratt. He started a nasty rumor about her that she made an inappropriate videotape with her ex-boyfriend, Jason. He eventually owned up to the lie and apologized to her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Photos Of Heidi And Spencer Pratt That Make Us Cringe (10 That Are Surprisingly Flattering)</a></span></p><p>For the longest time, Spencer denied starting the rumor and it only made Lauren angrier. Even after he apologized, she still knew deep down in her heart that she didn’t want to have him in her life as a friend.</p><h2 id=bff-audrina-patridge><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>BFF: Audrina Patridge</span></h2><p class=p1>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrina Patridge</a> and Lauren Conrad had a little bit of a shaky friendship for a while, after Lo&nbsp;Bosworth&nbsp;entered into the picture, Audrina and Lauren&nbsp;were able to patch things up and figure out their friendship.</p><p class=p1>It was important to both of them&nbsp;for their friendship to thrive and continue and even though there was outside pressure caving in on their closeness, they decided that they were going to make a conscious effort to fight back against any negativity so they could continue being friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enemy-heidi-montag><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Enemy: Heidi Montag</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi Montag</a> became an enemy of Lauren Conrad’s due to the fact that she chose to stay in a relationship with Spencer Pratt. She knew that Spencer started the nasty rumor about Lauren and chose to stay by his side anyway.</p><p class=p1>Instead of being a friend to Lauren, Heidi prioritized her relationship with Spencer. The fact that Heidi continued to move forward with her marriage to Spencer is what really ended the friendship between the two young women. There was never a chance for them to be close to each other again.</p><h2 id=bff-holly-montag><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>BFF: Holly Montag</span></h2><p class=p1>Holly Montag, Heidi Montag’s older sister, was one of Lauren's good friends on The Hills. They could relate when it came to the fact that they both missed the way&nbsp;Heidi used to be before Spencer entered into the picture.</p><p class=p1>Holly Montag moved to Los Angeles from Colorado to be closer to her sister and to create a fresh start for herself. She ended up getting kicked out of her sister's house (because of Spencer) and crashing at Lauren's for a while. Lauren Conrad definitely had her back, proving that the two are good friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=enemy-kristin-cavallari><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Enemy: Kristin Cavallari</span></h2><p class=p1>On Lauren Conrad’s last episode of The Hills, her facial expression when she found out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Cavallari</a> was at Heidi and Spencer’s wedding was priceless. Kristin Cavallari’s facial expressions were also priceless. It was clear to everyone watching that Lauren and Kristen did not get along with each other, at all.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Things Kristin Cavallari Likely Wants Everyone To Forget About</a></span></p><p class=p1>Lauren was shocked to find out that Kristen was at the wedding, but it made sense for Kristin to be there since she and Brody Jenner were the reasons why Heidi and Spencer were introduced to each other in the first place.</p><h2 id=bff-stephanie-pratt><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>BFF: Stephanie Pratt</span></h2><p>Even though Brody Jenner did his best to try to warn Lauren Conrad not to be friends with Stephanie Pratt, Lauren&nbsp;followed her own intuition and decided to befriend Stephanie anyway. Stephanie had a troubled past where she made mistakes in relation to addiction, but in her adulthood, she decided to live a sober lifestyle and become a better person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lauren knew that Stephanie was going to be a good friend to her. During their time on The Hills, they grew very close and they also both attended FIDM together.</p><h2 id=enemy-justin-brescia><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Enemy:&nbsp;Justin Brescia</span></h2><p class=p1>Lauren Conrad&nbsp;never really had any real or direct issues with Justin Brescia, but she never approved of the way he treated Audrina either. He mistreated Audrina for a very long time and Lauren&nbsp;saw how miserable it was making Audrina. As one of her best friends, Lauren&nbsp;didn’t want to continue seeing Audrina get treated badly by a guy that she was so head over heels in love with.</p><p class=p1>Lauren&nbsp;spoke up about this and gave her opinion a few times, but she felt like she was overstepping and didn’t want to jeopardize her relationship with Audrina.</p><h2 id=bff-whitney-port><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>BFF: Whitney Port</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney Port</a> is easily one of Lauren Conrad’s best friends. They worked together as interns for Teen Vogue and then again, for People's Revolution. They had one major thing in common with each other that helped guide their friendship - fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>The fact that they both had such a strong love for fashion and an intense desire to work in the fashion industry bonded them and connected them on a deeper level. They were always destined to be friends and to remain friends forever.</p><h2 id=bff-brody-jenner><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>BFF:&nbsp;Brody Jenner</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brody Jenner</a> and Lauren Conrad attempted to try out a relationship with each other, but both ended up discovering that they liked each other more as friends. They revealed that the producers of The Hills really wanted them to enter into more of a romantic relationship while they were on the show, but that the sparks just didn’t exist for them in that way.</p><p class=p1>A friendship between them was something that they both knew that they always wanted. They had mutual respect for each other, which is how longlasting friendships are built.</p><p class=p1><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Lauren Conrad Been Up To Since Leaving The Hills?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifoqScqHqtrdSrnKdlk6S7s63DZpmin5eawLV5xKecpqGVqHqjsdKtZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-jay-z-all-business-for-last-on-the-run-show-in-us-details-201478.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonce, Jay Z &amp;quot;All Business&amp;quot; For Last On The Run Show in U.S. Details">&larr;
