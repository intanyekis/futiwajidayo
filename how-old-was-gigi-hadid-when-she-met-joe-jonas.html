For about five months back in 2015, the duo was spotted out and about frequently, and fans were obsessed. At the time, no one gave much thought to how the two met, except that it was years earlier.Both were Hollywood stars, so it made sense that they knew each other and somehow got connected and began dating. But diving deeper, fans thought things seemed fishy. Here's why some say Joe and Gigi's meet-cute was not so cute at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gigi-hadid-and-joe-jonas-met-in-an-awkward-way>Gigi Hadid And Joe Jonas Met In An Awkward Way</h2><p>Admittedly, the story of <a href=#>how Gigi and Joe met sort of sounds cute</a>; Joe approached the model at an industry event. He asked Gigi to hang out, but she couldn't because it would have been kind of late.</p><p>Gigi admitted in an interview that she didn't want to tell Joe she had school the next day. But he didn't exactly give up. Instead, he gave his phone number to Yolanda, Gigi's mom.</p><p>Clearly, Yolanda handed the number off to Gigi, because that's how she and Joe eventually connected.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Gigi Hadidâs Most High-Profile Relationships">Gigi Hadid’s Most High-Profile Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no specific play-by-play as far as what happened before the two began dating years later. But at the time, Gigi was 13 years old. Joe, who is six years older than Gigi, would have been about 19, give or take a few months.</p><h2 id=fans-think-joe-jonas-was-being-creepy>Fans Think Joe Jonas Was Being Creepy</h2><p>Based on the former couple's age difference, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people tend to agree that Joe acted inappropriately</a>. To most people, it seems strange that a legal adult would want to date a teenager, let alone one who is so much younger.</p><p>At the time, Joe would have been the equivalent of a college student while Gigi was an 8th grader or a high school freshman. That perspective makes fans' icked-out responses to the situation more understandable.</p><p>While time has softened the awkwardness of the situation for most people, fans had thoughts about what went down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="3 Guys Sophie Turner Dated & 7 Girls Joe Jonas Dated (Before They Got Together)">3 Guys Sophie Turner Dated & 7 Girls Joe Jonas Dated (Before They Got Together)</a></span></p><p>One summed up their perspective by saying, "it is an adult acting out romantically towards a young girl." Another had one choice expletive for the fact that, "a whole bunch of media outlets treated it like it was a cute romance story."</p><p>It also gets worse, as a fan suggested, "She also said they remained 'friends' until they started dating when she was 18." This suggests that rather than meeting when she was 13 and reconnecting later, the two remained friends until Gigi turned 18.</p><p>Of course, timelines vary; most sources say the two began dating in 2015 which means Gigi would have been 20.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, fans could have forgiven Joe for thinking Gigi was older at first when they met. But the fact that he learned her age and continued to pursue her, they say, is not cool.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas-later-married-sophie-turner>Joe Jonas Later Married Sophie Turner</h2><p>Since Joe and Gigi split years ago, their past relationship isn't of too much interest today. But fans also take issue with <a href=#>Joe and his now-wife Sophie's relationship timeline</a>, citing what they believe is a pattern of behavior from Jonas.</p><p>One fan wrote, "He also started dating Sophie when she was at a young age and married her, and tbh she seems like a very vulnerable person."</p><p>Others agreed, saying that Sophie admitted to some mental health struggles, as well as said that being married and pregnant was something to 'focus' on to move on from Game of Thrones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Joe Jonas Shares The Sweet Moment When Sophie Turner Said Yes!">Joe Jonas Shares The Sweet Moment When Sophie Turner Said Yes!</a></span></p><p>Fans also speculated that the two were married too fast because Joe pushed Sophie into marriage. Sophie was about 20 when the two got together; Joe is seven years older.</p><p>Commenters thought that Joe probably pursued Sophie the same way he apparently did Gigi, and thought that the two having kids so early on was problematic.</p><p>One pointed out, "Originally when they got married she said she didn't want to have kids until she was older too."</p><p>Could Joe Jonas really be problematic? Anything is possible, though Joe's wife and ex-girlfriends only have positive things to say.</p><p>Except, of course, Joe's long-ago ex.</p><p><a href=#>Ashley Greene didn't have a good experience with him</a>; he spilled their intimate details to the world, leading to an Instagram post that fans interpreted to be about Joe, saying he had no class.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, fans of Joe will have to come to their own conclusions about his past behavior, while his marriage is obviously only his business and his wife's.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dpLmledaaqmafmZy2brTAnaCdZaedsq950qGcZqWVqXqru8Rmoaimkah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./laura-grillo-murder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laura Grillo Murder: Where Are John Makris, Jesus Trevino, and James Villeda Now?">&larr;
