She has also stated that her two sons are her top focus.</p><p>Redknapp recently talked about dating in an interview with The Times, saying: “People ask me about dating, and while I wouldn’t say I ever go out actively searching, I’ve got an open heart for what the future may bring. But at the moment, my boys and my job take up all of my energy.</p><p>So, even while it’s possible that Redknapp is in a secret relationship, there isn’t any proof that she’s dating anyone right now.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtooaNiubDByKycZqqVmbivrc%2BpZKKmXZZ6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-j-york-teases-general-hospital-return-amid-cancer-battle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John J.
