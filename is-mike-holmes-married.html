Since over twenty years ago, this wonderful builder, entrepreneur, and philanthropist has been a much-loved TV personality.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He is also quite active in his community. Fans are, as one might expect, quite interested in learning the finer details of the contractor’s life away from the camera. So, in no particular order, here is all that we learned!</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Mike Holmes Married?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>There are reports going around that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mike Holmes</a> married someone behind their back, but as far as we know, Mike hasn’t confirmed that he’s married. However, this does not rule out the possibility that he has a significant other in his life. The fact that he is in a committed relationship with his girlfriend, a model by the name of Anna Zappia, is something that he does not talk about very openly.</p><p><img alt="Is Mike Holmes Married" width=660 height=365 sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Is-Mike-Holmes-Married-1-660x365.png></p><p style=text-align:justify>According to reports, the pair has been together since the year 2000; however, they do not share any children together.

He had just divorced his wife, both of his parents had&nbsp;gone away, and he was on the verge of having to close his own company. Despite this, his firm was able to persevere, and he eventually met Anna Zappia. He was able to reestablish his building business and enter the television industry with her assistance.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even though Holmes was hesitant about participating in reality television, his family as well as his coworkers persuaded him to give it a chance. In spite of some early setbacks, the pilot episode of Holmes on Homes was broadcast, and the show went on to achieve phenomenal popularity. When Mike first got into the construction business, his objectives were not to become famous or wealthy but rather to educate homeowners and encourage more individuals to pursue careers in the sector.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>“One of the Best Things I’ve Done for Myself”</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Despite the fact that he is a well-known figure, there is very no information available about Anna. However, in 2015, Mike uploaded a picture of himself, his second daughter Sherry, and Anna attending the Kaleidoscope Ball. She does not have any social media accounts of her own.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>At the <a href=#>#KaleidoscopeBall</a> with Blake, <a href=#>@sherryl_holmes</a>, and Anna. <a href=#>#diversityshines</a> @TSHFoundation <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/e8MeLvuvGz</a></p><p>— Mike Holmes (@Make_It_Right) <a href=#>October 17, 2015</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Anna had a grin on her face as she leaned against Mike and held his side. As each woman sat next her respective date, Sherry, in a lime green dress, and Anna, in a dark grey clothing and brown hair, provided a striking contrast to one another. Additionally, she was seen on Mike’s account in the month of September. Mike uploaded a picture to social media on the 16th, showing he and Anna, along with several other people, drinking wine in Italy.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Mike added the caption “cheers” to the photo as everyone raised their glasses in the photo. Mike and Anna went to Casale Del Mare on the 20th, and Mike referred to it as “one of the best things I’ve done for myself.”&nbsp;Anna and Mike had a wonderful time. Anna had a beige purse with her while she was dressed in a black blouse and a skirt with a leopard print.</p><p><strong>Must Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Is Sports Commentator Stephen A Smith Married?</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Who Was He Earlier Married to?</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>In 1982,</strong> when Mike was only 19 years old,<strong> he and Alexandra Lorex tied the knot.</strong> The marriage between the pair was a joyful one, and it resulted in the birth of three children: Amanda, Sherry, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mike Jr</a>.
