Their characters deal with a lot of ups and downs, including crying, screaming and a few highly talked about nude scenes, as their union falls apart.</p><p>One viral moment is when <a href=#>the Guatemala-born actor</a> goes full-frontal — sending his social media fans into a tizzy. “You’re welcome, Twitter!” Isaac joked after being asked about the newsworthy scene, before noting he was “surprised” when he watched it back.</p><p>“I didn’t know that was going to happen. You get sent the stuff to look at and be like, ‘OK, I’m fine with that,’ but I saw it on a laptop quiet dark and I didn’t notice what was happening down there,” the Card Counter actor explained. “[But] clear as day, on the big TV, it’s there for everyone to [look at].”</p><p>Chastain also detailed what it was like <a href=#>shooting intimate scenes with such a close friend</a> and whether the characters’ dynamic took a toll on her.</p><p>“We’ve been friends for over 20 years. We went to college together. It makes it easier in that we completely trust each other. We love each other. We’re protective of each other,” the <a href=#>Eyes of Tammy Faye</a> actress said. “But, then it also makes it more difficult because we know how to hurt each other. So, in the scenes where the characters are hurting each other, sometimes I would look at him and [say], ‘Is this Oscar or Jonathan?’ It was good and bad for me.”</p><p>The actors previously made headlines in September when they showed off their chemistry at the Venice Film Festival premiere of their miniseries.</p><p>While walking the red carpet together, the Molly’s Game star and the <a href=#>Star Wars</a> actor <a href=#>cozied up to one another for the cameras</a>. At one point, <a href=#>Isaac kissed Chastain’s arm</a> and hand and pretended to propose, causing fans to freak out over the PDA.</p><p>“Oscar Isaac is making my blood pressure go up i need to get a grip,” one Twitter user wrote. Another fan commented, “This man exudes so much sex appeal WITHOUT EVEN TRYING.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The duo’s premiere poses were just for show as both stars are married with children. Issac wed <a href=#><strong>Elvira Lind</strong></a> in February 2017, one month before they welcomed son Eugene, now 4. They also <a href=#>share another child</a>, who was born in October 2019.</p><p>Chastain, for her part, married <a href=#><strong>Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo</strong></a> in 2017. The couple share <a href=#>daughter Giulietta</a>, 3, and a <a href=#>second child born in 2020</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGeq6OesKJ5wqGYrKyRnrtutMCdZGploqq5pnnFqKlmnJ%2Beu6h5za6bnmWjmLKvsdJmrqKsmGK8tK%2FAq2Siq5GWsHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shooter-jennings-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shooter Jennings Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
