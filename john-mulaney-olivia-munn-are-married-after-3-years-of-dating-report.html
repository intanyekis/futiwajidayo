Few details about the ceremony, which took place at a friend’s home, were revealed except that their 2-year-old son, Malcolm, and a witness were present for the nuptials.</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out for confirmation.</p><p>Us confirmed in May 2021 that <a href=#>the pair were dating</a> following <a href=#>Mulaney’s split</a> from his ex-wife, <strong>Anna Marie Tendler</strong>. Mulaney, 41, wed Tendler, 39, in 2014 and <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from his ex in July 2021. Their <a href=#>split was finalized</a> the following January.</p><p>Munn, for her part, was <a href=#>romantically connected</a> to the likes of <strong>Chris Pine</strong>, <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>, <strong>Matthew Morrison</strong>, <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> and more before beginning her romance with Mulaney. After news of their romance broke, quotes resurfaced of Munn, 44, stating <a href=#>she was a fan of Mulaney’s</a> in a 2015 conversation with HuffPost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/John-Mulaney-and-Olivia-Munn-Married.jpg><p>“We were at a wedding together and I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, do you and your fiancée want to go have dinner or something and go hang out?’” she told the outlet. “At first it was cool, and then I kept going up to him at the wedding like, ‘So, you having fun?’ I was just so obsessed with hanging out with and talking with him.”</p><p>During a September 2021 appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers, Mulaney announced that he and Munn were <a href=#>expecting their first child</a> together. They <a href=#>welcomed Malcolm</a> three months later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/John-Mulaney-and-Olivia-Munn-Married-2.jpg><p>“She and John are both very in love with their baby boy,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> Weekly in January 2022. “All seems to be going great with John. Having a baby has certainly brought them closer. She’s usually more private about her relationship but now she’s sharing more pics. It’s an exciting time.”</p><p>Later that year, another insider told <a href=#>Us</a> that the duo were “not in a rush to get married” after becoming first-time parents. “It’s definitely not [Olivia’s] focus right now,” the source explained in June 2022. “She really wants to enjoy this time as a new mom. Olivia’s fully embracing motherhood and all its challenges.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After primarily keeping their relationship out of the spotlight, Mulaney and Munn finally made their <a href=#>red carpet debut</a> at the 2024 Governors Awards in January. They followed up the public outing by <a href=#>attending the 2024 Oscars</a> together in March.</p><p>The happy news of the pair’s wedding also comes four months after Munn revealed she had secretly been <a href=#>diagnosed with breast cancer</a> last year, and underwent multiple surgeries and a double mastectomy.</p><p>“John has been a huge pillar of strength for Olivia throughout her health scare,” another insider exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in March, noting that Malcolm gives his mom the “courage and strength to keep fighting and overcome this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ijeq7By5qlnrFdpLmqwsiaZKatnqN6or7EZqSaqqKesqV5wJ%2BrnqpdaHq6scCrqmanlmKxosDIp55mqpWlvLPAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nikita-dragun.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nikita Dragun Bio, Controversy, Affair, Boyfriend, Relationship, Net worth, Transgender">&larr;
