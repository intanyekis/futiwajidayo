That's exactly what happened with DJ Qualls who regretted his Big Bang Theory role. It seemed like Qualls had auditioned for the role of Sheldon early on, and came up short. He wasn't comfortable in such an environment, and not even his friendship with Johnny Galecki could saved him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Reddit user</a> wrote that Qualls revealed he was close to Galecki.</p><p>"I also learned he and Johnny are really good friends and have known each other for 20 years and it sucked to have to quit a show that good with one of his friends."</p><p>The Reddit user adds that Qualls' appearance on the show turned into a nightmare behind the scenes given that the actor left after one episode, despite the fact that he was scheduled for a lengthy storyline arc.</p><p>"He was actually supposed to be in 10 episodes.

Qualls was actually in the running for the role of Sheldon, but came up short against <strong><a href=#>Jim Parsons</a></strong>. According to the actor, Chuck Lorre flat out told him he wasn't getting the role during his final read for the part.</p><p>“I studio-tested against Jim Parsons for that role. It came down to me and him. And they made us read, before all of the CBS studio executives, in front of each other,” he says.</p><p>“He went before me. And I turned to [creator] Chuck Lorre afterward and I was like, ‘I’m not going to get this part. I can’t read.’ And he was like, ‘Oh no, you’re not going to get this part – but you have to read.'” The “horrifying” experience so affected Qualls that “that was the last time I tested.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar50205888.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-14t095432-191.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Johnny Galecki Admitted His TBBT Mom Christine Baranski Was The Opposite Of What He Expected Behind The Scenes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Johnny Galecki had a different impression of Christine Baranski prior to her debut on The Big Bang Theory back in 2009.</span><p>It was a rough experience for Qualls alongside Chuck Lorre, and it seems like those issues carried over during his cameo on the series.</p><h2 id=certain-big-bang-theory-guest-stars-like-billy-bob-thornton-had-specific-requests-about-working-on-the-show>Certain Big Bang Theory Guest-Stars Like Billy Bob Thornton Had Specific Requests About Working On The Show</h2><p>Big Bang Theory had a stacked list of guest stars throughout its 12 season run. Among those major names included Billy Bob Thornton. However, it seems like <a href=#>the actor had specific conditions for working with Kaley Cuoco on The Big Bang Theory</a>.</p><p>Showrunner Steve Molaro revealed Thorton's pitch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar48825082.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It did come up a little bit, but he basically got to try to." Molaro continues, "The idea that came up of Penny taking her engagement ring off while she’s working had been floating around for a while. We thought, what if Billy is this socially awkward, sympathetic doctor who doesn’t quite know how to process Penny’s flirtations with him. We had that basic idea and went to Billy and his people ran it by them. Billy was on the phone, and he thought it was a really fun idea and was into it. That’s how it began."</p><p><strong><a href=#>Kaley Cuoco</a></strong> had a massive impact on getting guest stars. Even William Shatner agreed to the show, in large part, thanks to meeting Cuoco off-camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeo8Zus8ClnJyjmWKzs7XEp5tmnJpivraty6WqZpmcobKoscOlsGabkarAprCMq5ywqpmpsrR5zqdkrZqSqXqjscKarKydXaSzbrTIrGSpqp%2BXuaa5wK2gnGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6uLXToWScoKWYuG64zqupnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fairy-dresses-fashion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Magical Dresses With Gorgeous Fairy Vibes">&larr;
