Such is the case for&nbsp;Stevland Hardaway Morris AKA Stevie Wonder and his second wife Kai Millard. The now 71-year-old music icon filed for divorce from the fashion designer, 64, in 2012. They have two sons, Kailand and Mandla Morris. They had been married for 12 years. The ex-couple kept their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marriage away from the limelight</a> throughout the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two had already gone their separate ways in 2009. The&nbsp;Isn't SheLovely singer actually met his third and current wife Tomeeka Robyn Bracy, 46, before he filed for divorce from Millard.&nbsp;So was the divorce caused by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a third-party situation</a>? Here's what really went on inside that silent divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Why Did Nick Lachey And Jessica Simpson Get Divorced?

TV Might've Had Something To Do With It</a></span></p><h2 id=the-reason-stevie-wonder-filed-for-divorce>The Reason Stevie Wonder Filed For Divorce</h2><p>Stevie Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012, citing irreconcilable differences. No media outlet was able to gather more information. But documents released in public showed that the&nbsp;I Just Called to Say I Love You&nbsp;singer asked for joint custody of their sons, now ages 19 and 16. It was also indicated that Wonder signed an agreement to pay both child and spousal support and to split some assets. Many fans weren't happy to learn about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans argued that Wonder had already earned a great fortune way before meeting Millard. The singer-songwriter was a child prodigy who taught himself how to play various musical instruments like piano, the harmonica, and drums before he even turned 10. He was discovered by Ronnie White of The Miracles, a Motown band. Motown founder Berry Good Jr. immediately signed the young Wonder to a record deal after an audition.</p><p>In 1962, the&nbsp;Overjoyed&nbsp;singer released his instrumental album debut&nbsp;The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie Wonder.&nbsp;He was only 12 years old. Wonder then began to build&nbsp;his current net worth of $110 million. So the&nbsp;divorce was an understandable concern for his fans. Millard's net worth is estimated to be $1 million which already includes the child support they agreed on. The Grammy Hall of Famer must have had deep reasons for agreeing to support his ex-wife. Or he simply has plenty of money to share with the mother of his two sons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="'RHOBH' Cast Reacts To Co-Star Erika Jayne’s Impending Lawsuits & Unexpected Divorce" href=#>'RHOBH' Cast Reacts To Co-Star Erika Jayne’s Impending Lawsuits & Unexpected Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=the-hefty-price-that-came-with-the-divorce>The Hefty Price That Came With The Divorce</h2><p>Wonder and Millard agreed to share custody of their kids. The pop icon was also asked to pay $25,000 a month in child support. Despite the headlines about how hefty of a price that was, Wonder never release any statement. Millard also didn't speak about the matter.&nbsp;By the time these details were revealed, Wonder was already dating his current wife. They met in 2010 following his separation from Millard. They tied the knot in 2017. Usher, John Legend, and Pharrell Williams were in the ceremony. They&nbsp;now have two children; Zaiah, 8, and Nia, 6.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer supports a total of 9 children with 5 different women. Aisha, 46, and Keita, 44 are his first two children with Yolanda Simmons who worked at Wonder's publishing company in the 70s. Mumtaz, 38, is his third child with his ex-partner Melody McCulley. His fourth and fifth children, Sophia, 36, and Kwame, 32, are from an ex-partner whose identity was never revealed in public.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Interesting Details About La La Anthony's Marriage And Divorce With Carmelo Anthony" href=#>10 Interesting Details About La La Anthony's Marriage And Divorce With Carmelo Anthony</a></span></p><h2 id=stevie-wonder-and-kai-millard-s-current-relationship>Stevie Wonder And Kai Millard's Current Relationship</h2><p>Mutual respect for each is other is one of the probable reasons the ex-couple managed to have a quiet divorce. After they officially went their separate ways, they maintained a good relationship as co-parents to their kids. Stevie Wonder even graced the cover of&nbsp;ODDA Magazine's Fall/Winter 2020-21 Issue&nbsp;with Kai Millard and their sons. It was a feature about their unity as a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine went on to discuss the family's philanthropic and artistic ventures. Kailand recently established his clothing line House of Kom while Mandla continues to work on his R&B and "soul-influenced" music which he plans on releasing in a first solo album soon. Millard continues to work as a fashion designer and style influencer. She was recently given the opportunity to design for Vice President Kamala Harris. She's also an entrepreneur who's in the process of launching her very own skincare line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Stevie Wonder released new music after a 15-year hiatus. Where Is Our Love Song&nbsp;and&nbsp;Can't Put It In the Hands of Fate&nbsp;are his first non-Motown release. He released them under his own label, Republic Records. These latest tracks may be featured on an in-progress EP with some unrevealed guests. Wonder also announced that he has a gospel album in progress with Motown called&nbsp;Gospel Inspired by Lula which is&nbsp;named after his mother.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Everything Kim Kardashian Recently Revealed About Her Marriage And Divorce With Kanye West" href=#>Everything Kim Kardashian Recently Revealed About Her Marriage And Divorce With Kanye West</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqFdoratuMCrm2aln6e%2Fqr%2BMrKuerpmaeri7zZ2cq2WUnsOwvsKeZJygmaGxbr%2FUqaeoqqRivaLFzJ6lratf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-sandell-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thomas Sandell Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
