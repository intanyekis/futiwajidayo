title="Suggest Edits to Overall Meaning" href=#></a><br><p>The song Chalk It Out by Lil Wayne and Brisco is a deeply introspective and contemplative piece that showcases Lil Wayne's lyrical skills while exploring themes such as self-reflection, being true to oneself, and overcoming obstacles. The chorus is a repeated mantra of "let it all work out," suggesting the need to simply let life take its course and trust that everything will fall into place eventually. The verses are deeply personal, with Lil Wayne reflecting on his own experiences and struggles.</p><br><p>In the first verse, Lil Wayne acknowledges that he's made money but insists that it won't change him or come between him and his true self. He's also sipping on something that keeps him energized; he later refers to it as a "shit that give a flower color." Lil Wayne also speaks about facing setbacks from people pretending to be cool with him but ultimately betraying him, along with how challenging the game has been. And then, he goes into "letting it all work out." The second verse sees Lil Wayne reflecting on his life, acknowledging how far he has come and all the things he has lost in the process. The verse is a tribute to his mother, who provided the gun that nearly took his life but is also an avatar for self-reflecting and pull oneself together.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Let it all work out, let it all work out</u><br>Be patient and let things work themselves out</p><br><p><u>Work out, yeah</u><br>Trust the process</p><br><p><u>I'm in this bitch</u><br>I'm present and engaged in the situation</p><br><p><u>Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch But now I'm in this bitch</u><br>I used to observe from a distance, but now I'm fully involved</p><br><p><u>Tunechi, you a genius</u><br>Acknowledgment of Lil Wayne's talent</p><br><p><u>Looked in the mirror, said "Don't let the money come between us"</u><br>Reminder to stay grounded and not let success change who he is</p><br><p><u>I'm loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers</u><br>Although he has money and can do as he pleases, he still feels upset at those who have wronged him</p><br><p><u>I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color</u><br>He's drinking and taking drugs to cope with the stress and pain of life</p><br><p><u>And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble</u><br>He's been advised to stop worrying about the details and focus on the bigger picture</p><br><p><u>Real shit, look at my candle, still lit Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint</u><br>Despite hardships, he is still standing strong.
