She used dehydration methods to sweat out fluid before filming.</p><p>“I was eating very little, meditating all the time, burning candles and incense in my apartment,” Williams said. “I had to be up at 4 a.m. to start sweating. The night before, at about 7 or 8 p.m. I was allowed to have something salty and dehydrating — some smoked salmon and a tiny glass of wine. Then I had a boiling-hot bath with lots of salts in it. And I sort of levitated to bed and slept for maybe three hours, and woke up and had a handful of nuts. I wouldn’t be able to sleep through the night at this point.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Maisie-Williams-Reveals-She-Lost-Over-25-Lbs-to-Transform-Into-Catherine-Dior-For-New-Series-2.jpg><p>The actress’ routine was monitored by medical professionals who took regular blood tests and heart rate measurements. Williams previously took on a grueling role when she played Arya Stark for eight seasons of HBO’s Game of Thrones, but portraying Catherine forced her to “build different muscles.”</p><p>“[It] took over what I’m eating and how I’m moving and sleeping and thinking,” she told the outlet.</p><p>Williams has <a href=#>previously spoken</a> about struggling with her body image while filming Game of Thrones. She was cast on the show at just 11 years old and grew up on camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Maisie-Williams-Reveals-She-Lost-Over-25-Lbs-to-Transform-Into-Catherine-Dior-For-New-Series-3.jpg><p>“Around season 2 or 3, my body started to mature and I started to become a woman,” she told Vogue in October 2019, several months after the show’s conclusion. “But Arya was still very much, like, trying to be disguised as a boy.”</p><p>Williams continued: “I had really short hair and they’d constantly cover me in dirt and shade my nose so it looked really broad and I looked really manly. They’d also put this strap across my chest to flatten any growth that had started. I don’t know, that just felt horrible for six months of the year, and I felt kind of ashamed for a while.”</p><p>Since GoT wrapped, Williams has been able to embrace her body in a whole new way. “So, you know, we’ve this new phase of my style. Like, it’s nice to look more feminine and, like, have a real waistline and just, you know, embrace the body that I have,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While The New Look also put strains on her physical and mental health, the gravity and importance of the story motivated Williams to persevere.</p><p>“Every day of filming was a reminder that we were portraying a story of the horrors that humans are capable of inflicting on one another,” she told Harper’s. “But also the magic and the hope and the love. … Ultimately, we wanted to make a show that was uplifting.”</p><p>The New Look premieres on Apple TV+ Wednesday, February 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammZmotqZ51qKjpaGRosBuuM6sq2anppq%2Fbn6UZqObq12pvG68y5qwZpuRqbWmvsinnGacmaS%2FbrXNZquhnV2jsrh5y6impGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./piotr-iwanicki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Piotr Iwanicki">&larr;
