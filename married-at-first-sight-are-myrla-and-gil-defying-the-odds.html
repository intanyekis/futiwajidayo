Getting married without ever having met your spouse is difficult enough, but when you throw in the added stress of navigating each other's emotions, personalities, and temperaments for the very first time, the romance takes a turn, and sometimes for the worst!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans noticed <a href=#>Myrla and Gil struggling</a> at the start of their marriage, leaving them to worry for their future come decision day. While Myrla and Gil were at each other's throats, Zack and Michaela were kindling quite the spark, however, it <a href=#>seems as if the tables have turned!</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Fans Are Turning Against Johnny, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>Although Myrla and Gil found themselves at odds, especially when it came to <a href=#>Myrla making more money than Gil</a>, it seems as if they are defying the odds, and making their marriage work. As for the rest? It seems as if the struggle is real, and the sudden change in events when it comes to Myrla and Gil's love for one another is making viewers more hopeful for a successful end.</p><h2 id=myrla-and-gil-started-off-rocky>Myrla And Gil Started Off Rocky</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the MAFS couples first said their "I do's" it was clear that some would have it easier than others, but Myrla and Gil weren't one of 'em. The duo struggled immensely at the start of the season, worrying fans that Dr. Pepper and Pastor Cal may have made a major error in judgment.</p><p>Couples such as Zack/Michaela, Johnny/Bao, and Ryan/Brett were easing their way into their marriages, proving that being married at first sight isn't so bad, or so they thought! Tables turned quickly, and Myrla and Gil stand as one of the few couples who actually have a chance at making it the long run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the physical part of their romance took a while to form, sealing their first kiss last week, Myrla and Gil got down to the nitty and gritty before most of the other couples did. The two talked about their finances before the others did, all while ensuring they got to know one another before taking their romance to the next level.</p><p>"Myrla and Gil are really our favorite couple this season!" one fan wrote on Twitter, and boy are they right! While viewers didn't have the highest of hopes for the two, not only are they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this season's reigning couple</a>, but they're one of the few who are enjoyable to watch.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Fans Agree Ryan Isn't Attracted To Brett</a></span></p><h2 id=will-they-make-it-to-decision-day>Will They Make It To Decision Day?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During tonight's episode, Myrla and Gil speak with Pastor Cal and Dr. Pepper, and while Myrla showed up to her session feeling a little tipsy, she opened up more than she has all season. Fans were quick to point out how vulnerable she was with Dr. Schwartz, making it clear that she's getting more and more into the idea of making things work with Gil. In addition to opening up, Myrla is also becoming more comfortable with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the idea of moving in with Gil</a>, which would be a huge step in their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Gil, his session with Pastor Cal brought up a few red flags after pointing out that he's hesitant when it comes to his romance with Myrla, especially with decision day creeping up. Gil revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Myrla's sudden changes in attitude</a> is a major issue for him, so much that it would hinder his decision to stay with her when the time comes.</p><p>Pastor Cal was helpful in guiding Gil to help Myrla navigate her emotions, and get to the bottom of why she reacts negatively at times. Considering the Pastor referred to negativity in marriage as "cancer," it's evident that these two might have a little bit more to work on before decision day arrives.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Could This Be The End Of Jose And Rachel?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqinrKlecCtZJ%2BhoqjBbr%2FIoJ%2BtZZGnsm652KujmmWRo7Fus8ilZJ2dlq62r7OMrZ%2BeZZ%2BZsbR7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elmo-odwyer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elmo ODwyer">&larr;
