It's not easy to lose or gain 20, 30 - even up to 60 pounds - for any reason, let alone on a timeline that has to coincide with shooting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Needless to say, this kind of drastic weight gain and loss isn't recommended for health reasons. Most of the actors on our list had medical supervision during their journey to extreme weight change.</p><p>It's true that some characters definitely call for the kind of physique that your average A-list (or even B- and C-list) actors aren't sporting nowadays. Not everyone is slim and athletic, after all. As difficult as it must have been, though, with several Academy Award winners on the list, it seems like an effort that paid off in the long run.</p><h2 id=henry-cavill-dehydrated-himself-for-those-bathtub-scenes-in-witcher><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Henry Cavill Dehydrated Himself For Those Bathtub Scenes In Witcher</span></h2><p>Henry Cavill scored a huge global hit with The Witcher, and went through a strict regimen to get to that finely sculpted condition he displayed in the Netflix series.
