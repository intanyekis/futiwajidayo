He is a well-known rapper and actor. His net worth is estimated to be $50,000, which he has primarily earned through his music career. However, his net worth has also been contributed to by his acting roles in films such as “Cryptid” (2006) and “Just Another Day” (2009).</p><p>Petey Pablo had a challenging upbringing in a rough neighborhood, which led to legal troubles early in his life. After serving a five-year sentence for armed robbery, he decided to turn his life around and pursue a career in music. He managed to make a name for himself in the music industry after signing with Jive Records.</p><p>In 2001, he made a splash with the release of his single “Raise Up” and his debut album “Diary Of A Sinner: 1st Entry,” both of which achieved Gold status. His second album, “Still Writing In My Diary: 2nd Entry,” further cemented his success in the music scene.</p><p>Aside from his music career, Petey also ventured into acting, appearing in films such as “Cryptid” and “Just Another Day.” His acting career faced a setback in 2010 when he was arrested for carrying a stolen gun, resulting in a 35-month prison sentence. During his time in prison, he released a mixtape titled “Carolina #1” through his record label, Carolina Music Group.</p><p>After his release, Petey resumed his acting career and appeared in the TV series “Empire” in 2015. He is also working on his third album, which is yet to be released. His personal life includes a marriage to Amy Caro and two children. He was previously married to Monica Arnold from 1998 to 2000.</p><p>Petey has been nominated for several awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album for his album “Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry.”</p><p>His manager is Marion ‘Suge’ Knight, and he spent 5 years in a North Carolina prison for armed robbery before finding fame. This influenced his song “Stick em up” in his second CD “Diary of a Sinner: The Second Entry.”</p><p>He has also made appearances in various TV shows and movies, such as “Empire” (2015) and “Just Another Day” (2009), and has contributed as a music producer in the TV series “Empire” (2015).</p><p>Petey Pablo’s net worth may have the potential to increase in the future if he can stay out of trouble with the law.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xminnqyVrnqxrcGlpmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./slava-voynov-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Slava Voynov Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
