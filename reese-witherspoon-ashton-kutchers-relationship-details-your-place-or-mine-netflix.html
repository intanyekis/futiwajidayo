Astoundingly, despite bringing to life some of the most memorable characters in the genre, Kutcher and Witherspoon had never teamed up until 2022, when they both landed leading roles in the Netflix rom-com Your Place or Mine, which premiered on February 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, rather than herald Kutcher and Witherspoon’s return to the genre that all but made their careers, the film’s red-carpet premiere wound up evoking interest in an unexpected subject; the duo’s relationship. We take a look at Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon’s relationship, and why it’s evoked such fascination from fans in recent times.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mila Kunis Had A Different Experience Shooting With Ashton Kutcher On That '90s Show, Compared To Their Time On That '70s Show</a></span></p><h2 id=were-reese-witherspoon-and-ashton-kutcher-friends-before-your-place-or-mine><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Were Reese Witherspoon And Ashton Kutcher Friends Before Your Place Or Mine?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/reese-witherspoon.jpg><p>Despite more or less running in the same circles, Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher had not formed a real-life friendship until they were required to portray longstanding besties in the Netflix film, Your Place or Mine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The twosome even had to exchange videos to establish some familiarity before filming.
