The 39-year-old reality star and entrepreneur took to Instagram on Monday, Jan. 30 to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>debut her new nose</a> after having it reconstructed a second time. “So … this happened,” she wrote over an image of her bandaged nose on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Story</a>. “Most people would hide this, some maybe even deny this.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#ShahsofSunset</a> 'Shahs of Sunset' alum Lilly Ghalichi reveals nose job, shares recovery photos <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/MIxWmA8ie8</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/X4X27XiZFN</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Brightly (@BrightlyAgain) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 31, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In a follow-up video, seen above, she explained what led her to obtain a second surgery on her nose. <span>“I had had a previous </span>rhinoplasty<span> before, and although my nose was super cute — it was very cute — I couldn’t breathe for anything. I would sleep in these </span>strips<span> at night that would, like, open my nose,” the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lilly Lashes</a> founder recalled. “My nostrils, which are so perfect and even now, were completely </span>crooked<span>. My </span>septum<span> … was not straight, which was causing me to not be able to breathe, and my nose was crooked.” Her previous nose can be seen below.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lilly-Ghalichi-Nose-Job-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><span>Lilly went on to say she not only went under the knife again to fix her breathing, but because she felt “insecure” </span>about<span> how her nose looked. “I was scared because it’s your face. … So, is something worse going to happen?” she said, recalling her concerns before getting her </span>rhinoplasty. Luckily, everything worked out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><span>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of two</a> foreshadowed some backlash for talking about her procedure, so she came clean right away. “Let me disclaim by saying I did not get anything for free. I </span>paid<span> for </span>surgery<span> in full even though [my doctor] Jason is one of our best friends,” she claimed.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><span>Lilly concluded her video by turning off the face-smoothing </span>filter<span> and calling </span><span>her results “perfect”. She said, “I am 12 days post-</span>surgery<span>, so I’m still really swollen. But it’s </span>already<span> so </span>straight<span>. I can breathe so well. My </span>nostrils<span> are completely even. … He did an </span>incredible<span> job.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Unfortunately, Lilly was still trolled by followers who didn’t believe she paid for her nose job, but she quickly shot back. “I actually paid. A lot. I’m very successful if you haven’t noticed and I can pay for anything I want,” she wrote over a screenshot of a bully calling her a “liar”. She continued, “I posted because I am so happy with my results and wanted to help others that were unhappy with a previous surgery like me-not because I got anything for free, the DR wasn’t even aware I was going to post anything at all.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The Bravolebrity previously had work done in 2019 when one of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breast implants</a> ruptured. She wrote about the experience alongside an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> photo of one of her implants in October of that year. “This is an actual photo of my ruptured implant that was inside of me. Getting breast implants is a life long decision- you will likely need more surgeries and have complications, so I hope any girl considering them reads this and reconsiders to makes sure it’s really what she wants,” she frankly wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Don’t get me wrong, I love how my boobs make me feel more womanly, and in some sense more beautiful- but if I could go back in time, after all the problems I’ve had, I wouldn’t have gotten them,” she admitted. “I’m ok and healing well, I had an amazing Dr and didn’t explant but instead replaced the 1 because after years of having implants explant seems so scary to me right now- I’m not sure if I’ll be left disfigured without them. I share my story only because I know millions of young women look at me and others with implants thinking they need them too, so I just want all the women in that position to know things aren’t as perfect as they seem, and implants come with real risks.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5JqZqygkZ3AbrvFZqqupqOawW64yKWjsmWXna6ttcKhoGamn6iybrbOm2SbnZakv6Z5wJ%2BrnqpdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./big-sean-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Sean  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
