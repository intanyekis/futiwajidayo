But is her love life as blessed as her professional life? How about we say that her love life is even better than her professional life?</h3><p>Find all about Suzy’s boyfriend-turned-husband romance along with their number of children from this marriage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Suzy_Kolber_is_married_with_her_boyfriend_Eric_Brady%E2%80%94how_happy_is_their_family></span>Suzy Kolber is married with her boyfriend Eric Brady—how happy is their family?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Suzy Kolber has such a happy married life. She married her longtime boyfriend, <strong>Eric Brady </strong>in the year 2008. She and her husband are still enjoying their nine years of marriage to date. The couple even has a beautiful baby girl together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/reporter-suzy-kolber-married-to-eric-brady-in-2008-300x187.jpg><p>They decided on naming their kid <strong>Kellyn</strong> who is a beautiful baby girl by the way. She and her husband are doing a remarkable job in raising her, and their child is almost 9-10 years as they gave birth to their baby in the same year as they were married.</p><p><strong>Get To Know More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Shifrin Married Life, Wife, Children, Net Worth, Earnings, Salary, Height, Wiki-Bio</a></strong></p><p>Suzy and Eric have remained very private regarding their marriage. They are not active in any social media so far.</p><p>Suzy has not been spotted after the news of her daughter birth. It is quite difficult to get updates about her seeing how she isn’t even on any social media, so this will be all the news we have of her love life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25411ED200000578-0-image-a-78_1422823028376-300x187.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Suzy%E2%80%99s_professional_climb%E2%80%94More_on_her_net_worth_and_salary></span>Suzy’s professional climb—More on her net worth and salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Suzy Kolber is also a professional football reporter, sportscaster for ESPN and also a co-producer. Suzy Kolber is one of the original anchors of ESPN2 when it all first began. Before ESPN she worked in WPEC-TV where she worked as sports anchor only on weekends and feature reporter during weekdays.</p><p>Then she joined ESPN2 and covered many sports stories. But she left ESPN2 in the middle to join Fox Sports and later rejoined ESPN itself. She has covered many stories like National Football League, Grand Slam&nbsp;tennis&nbsp;events, 1996 ESPN&nbsp;X Games<span>&nbsp;</span>bicycle-stunt events, etc.</p><p><strong>Also See:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Liz Claman Married Life, Husband, Children, Net Worth, Earnings, Salary, Age, Height, Wiki-Bio</a></strong></p><p>She is best-known for having shows like Monday Night Football, NASCAR Countdown&nbsp;program, etc. on ESPN and being their reporter.</p><p>Suzy was the only female awarded with the Maxwell Club Award as the Sports Broadcaster of the year until 2006. She was also listed in the list of 10 favorite sports television personality according to Sports Business Daily’s 2004.</p><p></p><p>Having such great success, we have Suzy’s net worth to be <strong>$18 million</strong>. This is more than some of the celebrity we know as of today. We wish to see Suzy’ s dedication in the field of football reporting for a long time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Suzy_Kolber_Body_Measurement></span>Suzy Kolber Body Measurement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Height =&nbsp;1.7&nbsp;m or 5 feet 7 inches</li><li>Weight = 61 kg</li><li>Body Measurement = 36-27-36 inches</li><li>Age = 54</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qcpJ%2BosrV6wqikaKulr8Zut86lmZ6qXZuurrXLsmScoJmhsbOxzWakmqqinrKleceuqpuZnpl6pr%2FPp2SsmZyWv7p5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fredrick-james-prinze-jr-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-522937-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fredrick James Prinze Jr. Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biogr">&larr;
