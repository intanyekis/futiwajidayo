Given Sydney's newfound fame thanks to her deliciously captivating performance as Cassie Howard in HBO's Euphoria, as well as her work in The White Lotus, The Handmaid's Tale, Sharp Objects, and the NSFW Amazon film, The Voyeurs, all eyes are on who she's with. The lack of anonymity is one of the reasons <a href=#>she keeps her real boyfriend of three years a secret</a>. Because of her secrecy, there have been a lot of rumors about the famous men and women she might have been romantically involved with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no doubt that given her talent, star-power, undeniably beauty, charisma, and well-rounded energy, Sydney could have her pick of any famous man in Hollywood. But that's not her way. Even still, fans think she may have had a thing with a number of famous faces...</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-is-not-with-jacob-elordi-or-anyone-in-show-biz>Sydney Sweeney Is Not With Jacob Elordi Or Anyone In Show Biz</h2><p>There's just no way that Sydney Sweeney has been with anyone in this article outside of shooting steamy scenes with them. During her recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cover story interview with Cosmopolitan,</a> Sydney claimed that, at his point in her life, she refuses to date anyone in the public eye.</p><p>"I don’t date people in the spotlight. I don’t date actors or musicians or anyone in entertainment because I can just be normal Syd that way and it’s easiest. I have a great support system," Sydney admitted. "I have people who will battle for me and allow me to be on the pedestal and shine without making me feel like, Oh no, I’m shining too bright and I need to step back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent spotting by The Daily Mail</a>, it does seem as though Sydney is still with Chicago restaurateur, Jonathan Davino, a man 13 years her senior. This casts even more doubt on rumors that <a href=#>her relationship with Jacob Elordi </a>is more than just being his on-screen love interest. While the two insanely hot actors are constantly ripping each other's clothes off on Euphoria, they simply aren't together. Apologies to all the Reddit fans who have recently been shipping them after a somewhat flirtatious red carpet photo shoot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Jacob Elordi And Sydney Sweeney Had To Say About Their On-screen Romance In 'Euphoria'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This also means that Sydney has not been with any of her other co-stars. And she has certainly shared the screen with a few desirable men. She also spends time with some celebrities as well. This includes Machine Gun Kelly, who she first met while working with Pete Davidson on Big Time Adolescence. MGK later cast Sydney in his 2021 film Downfalls High, which features numerous songs from his album "Tickets To My Downfall".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-didn-39-t-have-a-romantic-fling-with-halsey>Sydney Sweeney Didn't Have A Romantic Fling With Halsey</h2><p>One of the reasons <a href=#>fans were so angry to find out that Jonathan Davino was Sydney's boyfriend</a> was that it seemingly dispelled rumors of a fling with Halsey. Those in the LGBTQA+ community were thrilled with an internet buzz that Sydney was involved with a woman. The rumors of Sydney's sexuality were sparked when she shared a Tweet of her with a woman at prom. Fans took this as her signaling to the world that she was, at least, bisexual. However, Sydney has never addressed the topic of her sexuality in public.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Sydney Sweeney Really Feels About Filming So Many Intimate Scenes</a></span></p><p>The rumors of Sydney's sexuality developed when she played a queer character in the Netflix comedy Everything Sucks! and when she was spotted hanging out with Halsey. The two women were also featured in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a scandalous photoshoot</a> in which both are in barely-three bikinis all over each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans immediately took to Twitter to both pray that the two were dating as well as to speculate that they were together. Reddit threads were even created to spark further rumors that these two women had the hots for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In reality, the two are very close friends and frequent collaborators. Sydney was featured in Halsey's music video for "Graveyard". Additionally, Sydney and Halsey are both involved in "A Player's Table", a show based on a novel that Sydney's production company acquired the rights to. The HBO mini-series is currently in development with both Sydney and Halsey set to star. However, the project has seemingly been put on the back burner after Jean-Marc Valle, who was set to produce, tragically passed away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney’s Creepy Fan Response Has Taken A Toll Due To Her ‘Euphoria’ Success</a></span></p><p>So, there seems to be no legitimacy to rumors that Sydney was involved with Jacob Elordi, Machine Gun Kelly, Halsey, or any celebrity, for that matter. However, if her relationship with Jonathan Davino continues, fans may just have to understand that the Euphoria star is simply not letting them (or a famous person) into her dating life.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney's College Professor Ruined Her Chances Of Getting A Business Degree</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqspyemsZuv9aenKedqWLApq%2FRnqulsV2ZrrW1zaBknJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./manny-leaks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Manny Leaks">&larr;
