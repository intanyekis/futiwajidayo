Hayley recounted Andrea's words, "'My daughter. She just performed, and she's starting out. She doesn't really know many people in the industry.

"I remember being 19 and spending time with Taylor when we were both finding our paths in the music industry. I went over to her place, and I must say, she's an amazing cook. She tried teaching me some cooking skills, although I didn't retain much," Hayley chuckled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-looking-like-she-is-throwing-shade.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That day made me realize how scattered my life was.

It's an ideal version of myself I aspire to be."</p><p>This meaningful episode provided the inspiration for Paramore's new track, "Running Out of Time."
