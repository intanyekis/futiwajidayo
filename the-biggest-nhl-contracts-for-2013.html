This year is not without its downside. Prior to the start of the season, the players and the league were on a lockout due to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) affecting the income of the players greatly as the total number of games was reduced from the original 82 to just a mere 48 games for the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of income, since the Stanley Cup is over and done with, it is an opportune time to know which players made the most money this year. For a sport that is very physical in nature, you would think that the players would be asking for more compared to other sports organizations like the NBA. The average NHL player makes only $2.4 million per season, as compared to the NBA’s average of roughly $5.2 million a year. While NBA’s <a title="LeBron James Net Worth" href=#>LeBron James</a>, <a title="Dwyane Wade Net Worth" href=#>Dwyane Wade</a> and <a title="Chris Bosh Net Worth" href=#>Chris Bosh</a> were all making around $17 million this year, the highest paid NHL player made way less than that.</p><p>There are many contentions as to who had the highest salary in 2013, depending on the details of the income generated. It is also important to note that since the season got shortened, the player salaries have also been pro-rated. Based on contract salary alone, the following are considered to be the Top 5 highest paid NHL hockey players for the 2012 to 2013 season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-vincent-lecavalier-tampa-bay-lightning><b>10.
