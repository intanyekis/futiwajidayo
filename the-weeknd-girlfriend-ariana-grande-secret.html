Surprisingly, internet users came up with a very crazy theory that the song I Heard You're Married is about <strong><a href=#>Ariana Grande</a></strong>. Of course, just the song's title alone is already thought-provoking, but when fans dived into the lyrics, they got the full scope of its meaning. In the song in question, The Weeknd seemingly opens up about having an affair with a woman who's already married as the track starts with the lyrics, "The way you hypnotized me, I could tell (uh) / You've been in control / You manifested this, but girl, I blame myself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then he sings, "It hurts to think I'm sharing you," and then he asks the woman, "why you even with him if you're cheating?" As the song goes on, The Weeknd decides to leave the affair and tells his partner, "I can't be with you / You're too deceiving, girl." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans said that the song could be pointing to an affair with Ariana Grande</a>. When the song dropped, people on Twitter posted comments like "I Heard You're Married by The Weeknd, Ariana I see you," and "The Weeknd? Is this about Miss Ariana Grande?" Here is why fans think The Weeknd was secretly dating Ariana Grande.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-the-weeknd-and-ariana-grande>What Happened Between The Weeknd And Ariana Grande?</h2><p>Where did all the talk about The Weeknd's affair with Ariana begin? According to fans, The Weeknd's famous exes like Bella Hadid and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> haven't gotten married yet, so the song had to be about someone else. As the theories point out, the one person Abel has been connected with who did get married is Ariana. But did Ariana and The Weeknd even ever date?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Ariana Grande's Excessive Tanning Proof Of Her Race-Fishing?</a></span></p><p>Dating rumors between them have been around ever since they did a collab in 2014 for the song Love Me Harder, which was the first time they came together. The song was a part of Ariana's album My Everything. The rumors continued when <a href=#>they collaborated on The Weeknd's Save Your Tears (Remix) in 2021</a> and Ariana's Off the Table from her album Positions, released in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although they never confirmed whether they ever dated, there was a popular fan theory that Ariana and Abel dated during their collaborative period. Some fans said that they confirmed that both stars might have had a secret relationship after they collaborated on Off the Table. The speculation started as a result of the song's lyrics: "I can you love you harder than I did before / Was in a dark place back then / I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else / I was haunted by the hills."</p><h2 id=did-the-weeknd-write-a-song-about-ariana-grande>Did The Weeknd Write A Song About Ariana Grande?</h2><p>Some social media users suggested <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weeknd's 2015 song The Hills was all about Ariana</a> based on these lyrics. In fact, some receipts indicated that the singers did have a thing in 2015. There was a theory that Abel had a relationship with Ariana as they recorded music together while she was dating Big Sean. Sean and Ariana broke up in 2015 for unknown reasons, and according to fans, that also hinted at Ariana and Abel's potential relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, part of the lyrics in The Hills said, "Your man on the road, he doin' promo," while Big Sean was coincidentally touring and promoting his album Dark Sky Paradise. Fans also said that more evidence of a romance between the stars was pretty evident in their collaboration Save Your Tears (Remix), released around April 2021, when Ariana was already engaged to Dalton Gomez.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why The Weeknd Almost Pulled Out Of Coachella After Replacing Kanye West</a></span></p><p>One of the lyrics in the first verse talks about the woman hiding someone's ring. Fans said that The Weeknd was a bit jealous in 2018 during the controversial Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson times. According to fans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weeknd seemingly threw shade</a> when he liked a fan's comment that reacted to a suggestion that the relationship between Ariana and Pete would not end well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-the-weeknd-and-ariana-grande-date>Did The Weeknd And Ariana Grande Date?</h2><p>With all the speculations on the internet, some fans called Dalton the third wheel in the relationship. For instance, in September 2021, Ariana and Dalton attended a screening of the horror movie Candyman, and they met up with The Weeknd once inside the venue. Even though The Weeknd was photographed by paparazzi separately entering the building where the screening was taking place, fans still talked about the relationship between Ariana and Abel. <a href=#>Several people pointed out that Dalton was the one-third wheeling at the event</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While listeners broke down the lyrics of I Heard You're Married it was only a matter of time before fans started coming up with other comparisons that allegedly proved that the song was actually about Ariana. For instance, in The Weeknd song, he sings, "You manifested this, but girl, I blame myself." If those words sound oddly familiar, it's because Ariana also sang about manifesting good karma in the track, Just like Magic. As the receipts keep accumulating, fans can't help but assume that both stars had a secret relationship at some point.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest Woman The Weeknd Has Dated, And Is She Richer Than He Is?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1drLKmt82dZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmmaKerq%2BtjKCpmqaUmnq0scKrnK1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jason-statham-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Statham's Net Worth: Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels (Of Cash)">&larr;
