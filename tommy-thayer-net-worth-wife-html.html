His net worth has been accumulated through his career that has touched the heights of success.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As he grew up listening to&nbsp;The Beatles&nbsp;and 60s pop music, Thayer eventually found a path to walk on when he started his band Black 'n Blue.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, Tommy began co-writing songs, and that's how he was exposed to his talent as a songwriter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Then in 1994 formed the super successful band&nbsp;Kiss,&nbsp;which garnered him significant attention in the pop world and helped Tommy solidify his name amongst one of the world's top guitarists with a hefty net worth.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Blissful Life Of William Tell & Lauren Conrad With Their Kids!!</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Thayer's legacy has helped many people break out of their shells and find passion in whatever they do.&nbsp;</p><p>As a passionate&nbsp;guitarist, he later started a website where people could reserve guitars to play for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">specified amount</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Surely, it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for many and helped him earn some. Back in 2020, he sold his gorgeous and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">luxurious</a> California Home for a solid price of $2.7 million.&nbsp;</p><p>As of 2022, Thayer sits at an enormous net worth that has now put him on a list of multi-millionaires. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Tommy Thayer on A Tour </strong>(Source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Although he enjoys his hard-earned net worth&nbsp;alongside his&nbsp;family, he also is very generous. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He has a foundation named&nbsp;Thayer Family Foundation&nbsp;which helps and supports the Oregon veterans, military personnel, and many more.</p><p>As massive success and fortune followed his life, so did happiness. One in such was a daughter he never even knew existed for over three decades.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tommy Thayer's Wife & Family&nbsp;</h2><p>Thayer married his former wife Amber Peek in 2006. The two met around 2003 and exchanged vows three years later.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two later on separated, but not much is known on the reason behind it; his former wife now runs her private atelier from her home in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</p><p>After their&nbsp;separation, Amber was in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship</a> with the guitarist of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Toto&nbsp;band, Steve Lukather.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But his separation from his ex-wife wasn't the end of his happiness. Happiness followed, ten folds greater when he found his 31 years old daughter through <a href=# rel="follow noopener">DNA</a> around 2020.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He shared how it all took place in 1989, and he never knew that he had a child, but fortunately, a second cousin of his was in contact with Sierra.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Another Member of the Band:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Sneak Peek on Peter Criss's Married Life & Rough Relationship History</a></p><p>He revealed the extremely happy news through his social media. On March 6, 2021, sharing the information among his fans and followers, he wrote, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This is a big one..
