Feider's Interior Canopy Treehouse: $18,800</strong></h2><p>Tree houses ideally are extensions of nature. However, gone are the days when dads would climb up the trees using a ladder, carrying with them a box of tools to build a tree house for their kids. Nowadays there are experts to do everything, but according to Dustin Feider the heavy beams used to construct the modern day tree houses are not for the environment. Feider's Interior Canopy Treehouse is like a Japanese paper lantern, spherical in shape. At night, when it is lit up, it glows through the trees, giving a very beautiful picture. The sphere is built using sustainable materials and hung from the trees using steel cables.</p><h2 id=9-the-monstro-ii-40-000><strong>9. The Monstro II: $40,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most amazing thing about this tree house is the attention given to the details. The Monstro II is intentionally dilapidated and lopsided. It is built on a huge, hollowed out, recycled log. This tree house is designed particularly for kids. The kids can enter the tree house through a door at the bottom, or they can also use the back door. There also is a small staircase that leads up to the first floor balcony. The log windows have tempered glass panes. The bear bench, the lantern and the little bird house are things that the kids will surely love.</p><h2 id=8-free-spirit-sphere-44-700><strong>8.

The Treetent was crafted by Dutch designer and sculptor Dre Wapenaar. It can accommodate two adults.

Cedar Spire: $93,600</strong></h2><p>This amazing tree house in Fife, Scotland resulted due to death by lightning. A Luxury estate owner in that region was unhappy when lightning struck their very old cedar tree. But instead of getting it cut down they called over the Treehouse Co. to spell their magic.

The walkway or the ramp has a network of trees to add to the adventure.</p><h2 id=2-modular-treehouse-approximately-1-9-million-extra-installation-and-land-charges><strong>2.
