He was the wildest, craziest, most outgoing, hard working, FULL OF LIFE guy we‚Äôd ever met. His ability to command a room and fill it with laughter and tears was like no other. We spent countless years taking amazing vacations and creating lifelong memories together, but the things I remember most were the lessons he taught me. To say that Travis had an impact on our life would be a giant understatement.</p><p>Travis has always been a class act, smiling through every adversity, and never losing hope. He was an amazing father, an amazing husband and an amazing friend. We are thankful we got the chance to be a part of his life. He was truly one of a kind, irreplaceable kind of guy. <img decoding=async height=16 width=16 alt=‚ù§Ô∏è src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ted/2/16/2764.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Keeping Brittany Just & their family close in prayer. <img decoding=async height=16 width=16 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tdb/2/16/1f64f_1f3fc.png alt=üôèüèº style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Obituary_and_Funeral_Arrangements></span>Obituary and Funeral Arrangements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The family of Travis Justt has announced that they will release the obituary and funeral arrangements for him.
