Before first landing the role in Homicide: Life on the Street in 1993, Belzer made his living as a stand-up comedian.

Richard Belzer first appeared as the detective in 1993 on Homicide: Life on the Street. He and the character moved over to Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 1999. He remained on the show until saying his goodbye in 2013. <a href=#>Many other actors have also left Law & Order after being on the show for long periods of time</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before leaving, however, Belzer portrayed the famous character of John Munch in many other television shows. Belzer made appearances in Law & Order, The X-Files, The Beat, Law & Order: Trial by Jury, Arrested Development, The Wire and 30 Rock. He also appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt as Munch. Belzer is the only actor to appear in 11 different television shows as the same character, and he at one time held the record for live-action consecutive seasons as one character.</p><h2 id=richard-belzer-did-voice-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Richard Belzer Did Voice Acting</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/richard-belzer-on-homicide-life-on-the-streets.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richard Belzer did not do a lot of acting after exiting Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Though he did not formally retire from acting until late 2016, he chose to take long breaks in between roles since he had never had that opportunity while playing detective John Munch. The actor also chose to take on more laid-back roles. He chose to do voice acting, which many actors nowadays have been dabbling in.</p><p>Belzer previously had worked as a voice actor. He played Loogie in one episode of South Park in 2000. He returned to voice acting in 2016 in the animated show American Dad! He voiced a detective on the television show, which was meant to be a nod to his previous role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kelli Giddish Want Her Law & Order: SVU Exit To Be Drastically Different?</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-belzer-was-an-author><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Richard Belzer Was An Author</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/richard-belzer-harlee-mcbride-and-robert-klein.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When fans think of Richard Belzer, they immediately think of the rational detective they saw on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In real life, however, Belzer was a big conspiracy theorist. The actor believed very strongly that there was a conspiracy behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and he wrote five books about his beliefs.</p><p>Belzer’s first book, UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Believe, was published in 2000. He then proceeded to publish more books about the conspiracy, including Dead Wrong: Straight Facts on the Country's Most Controversial Cover-Ups, Hit List: An In-Depth Investigation into the Mysterious Deaths of Witnesses to the JFK Assassination, and Corporate Conspiracies: How Wall Street Took Over Washington. His final book, Someone Is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?, was published in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-richard-belzer-returned-to-law-amp-order><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>When Richard Belzer Returned To Law & Order</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/LawAndOrder1.jpg><p>Though Richard Belzer left Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 2013, his formal goodbye to the character did not come until 2016. The executive producer of the show, Warren Leight, announced in March 2016 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Belzer would return to appear for one episode</a> of the hit television show.</p><p>The episode aired in May 2016 and way titled “Fashionable Crimes.” It was the 20th episode in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit’s 17th season. Fans of the hit show loved to see Belzer return to the character, and the reviews for the episode were very positive. Fans were particularly glad that the other characters did not make a big deal about his return. This would be natural of people who see each other regularly, which is the case of the characters in regards to John Munch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-belzer-rsquo-s-last-role-was-in-the-comedian><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Richard Belzer’s Last Role Was In The Comedian</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/richard-belzer-law-and-order.jpg><p>As previously mentioned, Richard Belzer formally retired from acting in late 2016. He had a long career in the entertainment industry as a comedian and actor, and he will forever be known for the role of John Munch. Belzer felt it was finally time to step away from his career and enjoy the later years of his life.</p><p>His final role in the entertainment industry was in the 2016 film The Comedian. The film starred Robert De Niro, Leslie Mann, and Danny DeVito. The movie tells the story of a comic icon attempting to reinvent himself after always being known for a role he played early in his career. Belzer played a version of himself in the film and had more of a cameo role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>While These Law And Order: SVU Episodes Are Fantastic, They’re Also Downright Controversial</a></span></p><h2 id=a-documentary-on-richard-belzer-is-in-the-works><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>A Documentary On Richard Belzer Is In The Works</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/richard-belzer-in-law-and-order.jpeg><p>Richard Belzer was friends with Bill Scheft for years.
