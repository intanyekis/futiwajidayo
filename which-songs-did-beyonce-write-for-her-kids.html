She exploded as a solo artist and has continued to dominate the charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as being one of the most famous women on the planet, Beyoncé is also a mother of three. She gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy in January 2012 followed by twins Sir and Rumi Carter, who were born in June 2017.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Beyoncé has opened up about her family in her music, even writing a few songs for her children. While the twins are yet to feature in Beyoncé’s music, Blue Ivy has also contributed to her mother’s work.</p><p>These are the songs Beyoncé wrote for her children, and what she has said about being a mother.</p><h2 id=which-song-did-beyonc-eacute-write-for-blue-ivy>Which Song Did Beyoncé Write For Blue Ivy?</h2><p>Looking at Beyoncé’s impressive repertoire of songs, it’s not difficult to guess which one she wrote for Blue Ivy, her oldest daughter who was born in 2012.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyoncé's Mom Shares Another Secret To B's Success</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song Blue appeared on her 2013 album Beyoncé. “Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you,” Beyoncé sings. “'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive.”</p><p>Blue Ivy herself actually features on the song, and was one of the youngest artists ever to do so. Beyoncé finishes the song with the lyrics, “Hold on to me, Blue.”</p><p>Then Blue, who was only a baby at the time, says, “Hold on to me, hold on. Been-sy-ay, Been-sy-ay (presumably trying to say Beyoncé). Blue, Mommy, mommy, mommy. Can we see daddy? Can we see daddy? Missus Carter! Missus Carter!”</p><h2 id=is-blue-ivy-a-grammy-award-winning-artist>Is Blue Ivy A Grammy-Award Winning Artist?</h2><p>Blue Ivy first appeared on the song Blue in 2013 when she was just one year old. Fans could tell then that her future in the music industry was going to be bright.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue was the second-youngest artist to ever win a Grammy Award</a> when she took home the award for Best Music Video. The song was Brown Skin Girl, which Blue sang on and was also credited with writing parts of, in addition to appearing in the music video with her mom.</p><p>Rumi, Beyoncé’s youngest daughter, also had a cameo in Brown Skin Girl with her sister, mother, and grandmother Tina Knowles.</p><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-mentions-blue-and-rumi-in-other-songs-too>Beyoncé Mentions Blue And Rumi In Other Songs Too</h2><p>In 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z released a joined record under the name The Carters. EVERYTHING IS LOVE featured the song Lovehappy, in which Beyoncé also mentions her two daughters by name.</p><p>“… twinning—Blue and Rumi, me and Solo are winning.”</p><p>On the track, Jay-Z also calls out the couple’s son Sir, singing, “Sir asked it, like his dad’s s--- is trippy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple addresses the cheating rumors that have plagued their relationship in the song, with Beyoncé singing in the chorus, “You did some things to me, boy, you do some things to me. But love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change. Baby, the ups and downs are worth it.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Have Beyoncé And Jay-Z Been Up To The Past Year?</a></span></p><p>The Carters also featured Blue in the song Boss who gives a shout-out to twins Rumi and Sir: “Shout out to Rumi and Sir, love Blue.”</p><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-often-sings-about-motherhood>Beyoncé Often Sings About Motherhood</h2><p>Along with mentioning her children directly in her songs, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé also often sings about the experience of motherhood</a> in general.
