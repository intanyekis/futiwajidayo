He is a celebrity child that is why he is a subject of discussion in the media. You will get to more about him in this post.</p><p>Currently, River Jones Johnson is merely a young child. However, he is already well-known in the media as the son of American actress and model Paulina Gretzky. His father is socialite and PGA TOUR golfer Dustin Johnson from the United States. In addition, River Jones is well known for being the grandson of Wayne Gretzky, one of the all-time great ice hockey players.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_River_Jones_Johnson></span>How old is River Jones Johnson<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>River Jones Johnson </a>is currently five years old. He is the second child of Paulina Gretzky and Dustin Johnson, was born on June 12, 2017, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Paulina, River Jones’ mother, reportedly revealed her pregnancy in February 2017. In a now-deleted Instagram photo, she displayed her expanding baby belly by putting her palm on it.</p><p>After the news was announced, River’s parents even shared the baby’s sex in a later-deleted Instagram video. The brief beachside video clip showed Dustin, the soon-to-be dad, hitting a golf ball off the sand, which blew off and produced a cloud of blue dust. Then Dustin exclaimed, “Another boy!”</p><p>River Jones Johnson, the second child of Paulina Gretzky and Dustin Johnson, was born on June 12, 2017, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Then Dustin exclaimed, “Another boy!”</p><p>In addition, River’s distraught father, Dustin, even shared a family photo on Instagram after River arrived. In the picture, Tatum Johnson, the father’s eldest son, was kissing the infant while Johnson’s wife, Paulina, was carrying the newborn.<br>Tatum Gretzky Johnson, River’s elder brother, was born on January 19, 2015, in Los Angeles, California. Dustin and Paulina claim that the moment their first baby was born, their lives were dramatically changed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=River_Jones_Johnson_meaning></span>River Jones Johnson meaning <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>River is a no gender specified name. It has English origin and it refers to a stream of water that flows into the sea.</p><p>But there’s a strange explanation for why Dustin and Paulina gave their son the name River Jones. Sources claim that Paulina named the baby girl River after the Riviera Course in Los Angeles. Dustin won the Genesis Open there in 2017 and rose to the top of the world as a result. Similar to this, she gave Dustin’s late grandma’s last name and her own mother’s second name, Jones, to her kid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>River Jones Johnson, the son of Dustin Johnson and Paulina Gretzky, is growing up learning his father’s golf swing and his grandfather’s ice hockey talents. However, based on his performances in the two games, it appears that he is already emulating his famous hockey-playing grandfather.</p><p>River Jones’ mother, Paulina, posted a video of him playing hockey with his grandfather on Instagram in 2019 when he was only two years old. Even at such a young age, River was paying close attention as his grandfather taught him skills. That does not imply, though, that River is not interested in the game. He also exhibits a strong interest in golf, and occasionally, you may see him practicing with his father on the course.</p><p>But River is now a young child. The youngest Johnson still has time to decide whether or not he truly wants to play sports when he grows up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Dustin_Johnson_and_Paulina_Gretzky_married></span>Are Dustin Johnson and Paulina Gretzky married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, they are not married yet. Although Paulina Gretzky and Dustin Johnson, the parents of River Jones Johnson, have been dating for almost ten years, they have not yet wed. According to accounts, Dustin met Paulina, his soul mate, in the end of 2011 through Janet Gretzky. However, because both of them were committed to other people, they did not start dating until 2012.</p><p>Then, just seven months after they started dating, Gretzky and Johnson were engaged in August 2013. While the majority of their fans are anticipating their wedding day, they have not yet made the date public. However, Paulina already revealed in an Instagram story that she will tie the knot shortly in the wonderful state of Tennessee. We should soon learn about River’s mother and father getting married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0edGirZ6qXZ%2B8r7HSZqGooJ6ovK95w66qraGeYrewtM2spqdlkaOxbrzArqOippFitLOx07OismWjpLturculZLKnpWK7prHDZquoZZujvLh5wJumrqxdqbWmediorKefXZe8uns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-tv-couples-that-actually-despise-each-other.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 TV Couples That Actually Despise Each Other">&larr;
