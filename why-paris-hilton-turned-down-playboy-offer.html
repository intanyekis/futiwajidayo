Despite her refusal, the heiress revealed she was made the cover of the controversial magazine. And Hilton is now speaking out about her experience.</p><h2 id=how-other-playboy-models-feel-about-their-cover>How Other Playboy Models Feel About Their Cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hugh-hefner-looking-upset.jpg><p><a href=#>Hilton's story is not unique.</a> Former Girls Next Door stars Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt have shared their negative experiences at the Playboy Mansion, where they were asked to have sex with Hefner in front of other women who hated them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Such revelations have raised questions about how women were treated at the Playboy Mansion and the ethical implications of using women's bodies for commercial purposes.</p><p>Despite the negative experiences of some women, others have enjoyed appearing in Playboy over the years, such as Dolly Parton and Pamela Anderson.</p><p>Dolly Parton recreated her infamous Playboy cover at the age of 75. Pamela Anderson, who has appeared on the cover of Playboy more than any other person, revealed that Hugh Hefner was the one person throughout her entire career whom she felt treated her with respect throughout her entire career.</p><p>However, the legacy of Playboy magazine is complicated. Heather Rae El Moussa has complicated feelings about her work with the magazine. While she acknowledges that it "catapulted" her career, she is unsure how to tell her children about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine's legacy and cultural place are being reexamined as society evolves.

While the magazine claimed to empower women by featuring articles on women's issues and interviews with prominent female figures, the images of nude or scantily clad women garnered the most attention.</p><p>Critics argue that Playboy's representation of women was a regressive and narrow view of femininity that reduced women to objects of male desire.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Prior To Stepping Foot In The Playboy Mansion, Rob Lowe Revealed He Already Felt 'Less Than'</a></span></p><p>Moreover, the magazine has been criticized for lacking diversity regarding the models featured and the content it produced. Playboy's idealized image of beauty was often limited to a particular body type, which did not represent the diverse range of women's bodies.</p><p>This narrow view of beauty reinforced unrealistic and unhealthy body standards for women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine stopped featuring nude models in 2016, signaling a shift towards a more inclusive and modern approach to sexuality. However, more than this change was needed to save the magazine, which ceased publication in 2020 after a 66-year run.</p><h2 id=how-paris-hilton-landed-the-cover-of-playboy-magazine>How Paris Hilton Landed The Cover of Playboy Magazine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/paris-hilton-when-she-was-young.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hefner offered Hilton</a> increasing money and accommodations to entice her, but she ultimately declined because she knew her mother would disapprove.</p><p>In her memoir, Paris: The Memoir, Hilton candidly writes about this experience and the dark side of fame during that time. She considered all of the things Hefner offered but kept hearing her mother's reaction in the back of her mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her refusal, Hefner went out of his way to obtain a photo of her from an old photo shoot and gave her an award, which allowed him to feature her on the cover of Playboy without her consent.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-39-s-reaction-to-being-on-the-cover-of-playboy-magazine>Paris Hilton's Reaction to Being on The Cover of Playboy Magazine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/paris-hilton-mtv-movie-awards.jpg><p>Paris reflects on the experience and explains how she felt honored and yet upset at the same time. She cried, and her parents were angry, but they didn't confront Hefner, as that was not something one would do.</p><p>The star details her reaction when she found out she was the cover, "I was like, 'Whut?' Hef had 'honored' me with the Sex Star of the Year Award, which means they can claim it's 'news,' and not a pictorial," Hilton told People.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'It’s Hard To Explain’: Paris Hilton Opens Up On Her Past Abusive Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He got a picture from an old test shoot with a woman photographer.

She has been candid about needing to work through her feelings about sex, and her memoir reflects that.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpa6ztdJmn6KkpKS7bsDUq6WenF2ZvLi6jKmjmrGSpMZuu8WfnKtn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-old-was-gigi-hadid-when-she-met-joe-jonas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Jonas And Gigi Hadid's Relationship Was Not A &amp;quot;Cute Romance Story&amp;quot;">&larr;
